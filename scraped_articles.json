While she still has a long road ahead of her, I'm extremely hopeful that she's going to make a full recovery,\" Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director at the Northwestern Medicine Lung Transplant Program, said during a press conference in Chicago on Thursday.\n\n\"Yesterday she smiled and told me this one sentence. She said, 'Doc, thank you for not giving up on me,'\" Bharat said. \"If she didn't get the transplant, she would not be alive.\"\n\nThe hospital said it believes this is the first time such an operation on a Covid-19 patient has been performed successfully in the United States, and it offers new hope for patients with extensive lung damage from coronavirus infection.\n\nThe patient, a Hispanic woman in her 20s, spent six weeks on a ventilator and an ECMO machine while in the hospital's intensive care unit as her body fought the coronavirus infection.\n\n\"For many days, she was the sickest person in the Covid ICU -- and possibly the entire hospital,\" Dr. Beth Malsin, pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said in a press release Thursday.\n\n\"There were so many times, day and night, our team had to react quickly to help her oxygenation and support her other organs to make sure they were healthy enough to support a transplant if and when the opportunity came,\" Malsin said. \"One of the most exciting times was when the first coronavirus test came back negative and we had the first sign she may have cleared the virus to become eligible for a life-saving transplant.\"\n\nA need for new lungs\n\nIt was early June when the patient's lungs showed signs of irreversible damage due to Covid-19, according to the hospital.\n\nTransplant surgeon Dr. Ankit Bharat while caring for the first US double lung transplant in a Covid-19 survivor.\n\n\"A lung transplant was the only option,\" Bharat said.\n\n\"She was starting to develop multi-organ failure from the result of the permanent damage that she had,\" he said. \"As a result of the severe injury, the pressure inside the lungs started to really go up and the heart then started to fail -- and when the heart starts to fail then the blood starts to back up, so the liver starts to fail and then the kidney starts to fail.\"\n\nBharat added that before the patient could be listed for a lung transplant, she had to test negative for Covid-19\n\nIt took about five weeks for the patient to clear the virus before her surgery -- and while normally a patient would be notified of the lung transplant surgery, it was too risky to wake up her while she was on a ventilator, her doctors said.\n\nThe young woman's lungs were severely damaged after she battled Covid-19.\n\n\"Normally we try to wake every patient up before we offer them lung transplant. We want to make sure that the patient knows,\" Bharat said.\n\n\"In her situation, we tried to do the same thing, but her lungs were so badly injured we just could not wake her up,\" he said. \"We had to rely on her family, her power of attorney, her mom and her caregivers to understand her wishes and that's what helped us make the decision. It's an unusual situation in her case.\"\n\nDoctors quickly listed the young woman for a double lung transplant once it was confirmed that she tested negative for Covid-19, and the 10-hour transplantation operation was performed 48 hours later.\n\nThe patient's family is now able to visit her in the hospital while she recovers.\n\n\"They're quite ecstatic,\" Bharat said. \"She's able to FaceTime with her family. She's able to talk to her significant others.\"\n\n'There's still so much we have yet to learn'\n\nMore research is needed to gather data on exactly how many severe Covid-19 patients could benefit from this operation, Bharat said during Thursday's press conference.\n\n\"We are one of the first health systems to successfully perform a lung transplant on a patient recovering from COVID-19,\" he said. \"We want other transplant centers to know that while the transplant procedure in these patients is quite technically challenging, it can be done safely, and it offers the terminally ill COVID-19 patients another option for survival.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBharat and his colleagues also want to learn more about the patient's sickness and recovery.\n\n\"How did a healthy woman in her 20s get to this point?\" Dr. Rade Tomic, a pulmonologist and medical director of the Lung Transplant Program, said in the press release.\n\n\"There's still so much we have yet to learn about Covid-19. Why are some cases worse than others? The multidisciplinary research team at Northwestern Medicine is trying to find out,\" Tomic said. \"While this young woman still has a long and potentially risky road to recovery given how sick she was with multi-organ dysfunction for weeks preceding the transplant, we hope she will make a full recovery.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/11/health/lung-transplant-covid-19-northwestern/index.html", "published": "2020-06-11T00:00:00"}, {"title": "US human trials begin for first antibody cocktail that might treat and prevent Covid-19", "author": ["Jen Christensen"], "text": "(CNN) A medicine that may treat and prevent Covid-19 is now being tested in patients in multiple sites around the United States, according to an announcement Thursday from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nIt is the first trial of a Covid-19 antibody cocktail in the United States.

Regeneron said its antibody cocktail will be tested in four separate study populations: people who are hospitalized with Covid-19; people who have symptoms for the disease, but are not hospitalized; people who are healthy but are at a high risk for getting sick; and healthy people who have come into close contact with a person who is sick.\n\n\"We have created a unique anti-viral antibody cocktail with the potential both to prevent and treat infection, and also to preempt viral 'escape,' a critical precaution in the midst of an ongoing global pandemic,\" Dr. George Yancopoulos, co-founder, president and chief scientific officer at Regeneron, said in a press release. \"Ultimately, the world needs multiple solutions, and the innovative biopharma industry is collectively working hard to help as many people as possible with a variety of complementary approaches.\"\n\n\n\nAntibodies are proteins the body naturally makes to protect the body from a threat like Covid-19.

The CDC also estimates that 40% of coronavirus transmission is occurring before people feel sick, meaning they are presymptomatic.\n\nBut it may boil down to how one defines \"asymptomatic.\"\n\n'There are so many unknowns'\n\nMaria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of its emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said during a media briefing in Geneva on Monday that \"it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual.\"\n\nBut then on Tuesday, during the live Q&A, she clarified \"this is a major unknown.\"\n\n\"The majority of transmission that we know about is that people who have symptoms transmit the virus to other people through infectious droplets -- but there are a subset of people who don't develop symptoms, and to truly understand how many people don't have symptoms, we don't actually have that answered yet,\" Van Kerkhove said.\n\n\"We do know that some people who are asymptomatic, or some people who don't have symptoms, can transmit the virus on,\" she said. \"So what we need to better understand is how many of the people in the population don't have symptoms and separately how many of those individuals go on to transmit to others.\"\n\nOn Monday, Van Kerkhove had said that what appear to be asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 often turn out to be cases of mild disease.\n\n\"When we actually go back and we say how many of them were truly asymptomatic, we find out that many have really mild disease,\" Van Kerkhove said on Monday.\n\n\"They're not quote-unquote Covid symptoms -- meaning they may not have developed fever yet, they may not have had a significant cough, or they may not have shortness of breath -- but some may have mild disease,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"Having said that, we do know that there can be people who are truly asymptomatic.\"\n\nVan Kerkhove added that she was referring to reports from WHO member states when she made her comments on Monday.\n\n\"What I was referring to yesterday in the press conference were very few studies -- some two or three studies that had been published that actually try to follow asymptomatic cases, so people who are infected, over time, and then look at all of their contacts and see how many additional people were infected,\" Van Kerkhove said.\n\n\"And that's a very small subset of studies. So I was responding to a question at the press conference. I wasn't stating a policy of WHO or anything like that,\" she said. \"Because this is a major unknown, because there are so many unknowns around this, some modeling groups have tried to estimate what is the proportion of asymptomatic people that may transmit.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the day after WHO's live Q&A, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the United States, weighed in on Van Kerkhove's original comments. He said it \"was not correct\" to describe asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus as rare.\n\nEvidence shows that 25% to 45% of infected people likely don't have symptoms, Fauci told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"And we know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they're without symptoms,\" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\"So to make a statement to say that's a rare event was not correct.\"\n\nAnd while the public might use the word \"asymptomatic\" to describe any infected person who doesn't have symptoms, the bigger concern may be infection from \"pre-symptomatic\" carriers.\n\nHow the virus spreads\n\nDr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, also said during Tuesday's live Q&A that there is still much to learn about the possible asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"Whatever proportion of disease is transmitting from asymptomatic individuals, as Maria said, that is unknown,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"I'm absolutely convinced that that is occurring. The question is how much,\" he said. \"There's much to be answered on this. There's much that is unknown.\"\n\n'Trying to slice the salami very fine'\n\nWhether someone is presymptomatic or or simply experiencing very mild symptoms is not of importance to the person on the receiving end of the transmission, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University professor and longtime adviser to the CDC.\n\n\"I thought they were getting very prissy and trying to slice the salami very fine,\" Schaffner said about WHO's comments on Monday on asymptomatic spread.\n\n\"You can be vertical and feel 100% or virtually 100% and going about your daily business and unaware that you're infected and perfectly capable transmitting the virus,\" Schaffner said. \"How do we inhibit transmission of the virus by these people who are doing their full range of normal activities? The answer is social distancing and wearing masks and good hand hygiene and stay away from crowds.

He was referring to research that estimates shutdown measures through early April prevented more than 500 million coronavirus infections across six countries.\n\n\"There remains scientific uncertainty, but asymptomatic infection could be around 30% to 50% of cases,\" Smeeth said. \"The best scientific studies to date suggest that up to half of cases became infected from asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/09/health/who-coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread-bn/index.html", "published": "2020-06-09T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Dexamethasone and Covid: Steroid reduces risk of death in severe coronavirus patients, trial suggests", "author": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "text": "(CNN) The widely available steroid drug dexamethasone may be key in helping to treat the sickest Covid-19 patients who require ventilation or oxygen, according to researchers in the United Kingdom.\n\nTheir findings are preliminary, still being compiled and have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal -- but some not involved with the study called the results a breakthrough\n\nThe two lead investigators of the Recovery Trial , a large UK-based trial investigating potential Covid-19 treatments, announced to reporters in a virtual press conference on Tuesday that a low-dose regimen of dexamethasone for 10 days was found to reduce the risk of death by a third among hospitalized patients requiring ventilation in the trial.\n\n\"That's a highly statistically significant result,\" Martin Landray, deputy chief investigator of the trial and a professor at the University of Oxford , said on Tuesday.\n\n\"This is a completely compelling result. If one looks at the patients who did not require ventilators but were on oxygen, there was also a significant risk reduction of about one-fifth,\" Landray said. \"However, we didn't see any benefit in those patients who were in hospital, had Covid, but whose lungs were working sufficiently well -- they were not taking either oxygen or on ventilators.\"\n\nLandray added that \"there are outstanding questions\" and people treating Covid-19 at home should not be taking dexamethasone on the back of these results.\n\n\"We have not studied patients in the community,\" Landray said. \"We show no effect in the patients who are not on oxygen and we did not study the patients who are not in hospital.\"\n\nThe dexamethasone arm of the Recovery Trial closed last week and researchers are now compiling its data. It included about 2,100 hospitalized Covid-19 patients who were randomized to receive dexamethasone, and about 4,300 hospitalized Covid-19 patients who were randomized to receive the usual standard of care at their hospitals.\n\n'Our focus was on mortality'\n\nIn the trial, dexamethasone was provided at a dose of 6mg once a day for up to 10 days, administered either as an injection or taken orally. The researchers reported no serious adverse events among the patients taking dexamethasone, but the results are preliminary.\n\n\"At this stage, we found no clear adverse effects of doing this. Let's recognize that there are sort of two messages here. In the people who required oxygen or ventilation, it clearly works, and the benefits are biggest for those on ventilators. In the people in hospital with Covid who do not require oxygen -- so, their lungs are working moderately well -- then actually there's no benefit,\" Landray said on Tuesday.\n\n\"In the trial, our focus was on mortality, which obviously a drug can affect in either direction, but the overall results in the patients on oxygen and ventilation was a clear, clear benefit,\" Landray said, adding that deaths in the study were examined over a 28-day period. \"We've looked, for example, were there deaths due to other forms of infection, which are sometimes considered a risk? And the answer is no, there was no excess of any other particular cause of death.\"\n\nIn the United States, dexamethasone already has been used to treat some Covid-19 patients during the pandemic.\n\nWhen told about the preliminary Recovery Trial results, Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, the regional director for critical care at Northwell Health, which owns 23 hospitals in New York, said to CNN, \"We've used it for Covid from the beginning.\"\n\n'It's a readily available, cheap and well understood drug'\n\nDexamethasone has been a controversial drug when it comes to treating respiratory viral infections, Peter Horby, chief investigator for the Recovery Trial and a professor at the University of Oxford , said on Tuesday.\n\n\"This was included in the Recovery Trial because it's a readily available, cheap and well understood drug, and because there have been reports in the past of benefit in viral respiratory infections, but it's been an area of huge controversy,\" Horby said.\n\n\"Even at the time of SARS1 in 2003, steroids were used, but at very different doses. Some of the studies showed a harm from steroids in SARS, some said there's possible benefits. A meta-analysis in 29 different studies in SARS was inconclusive. There's also been inconclusive results on MERS coronavirus and also influenza,\" Horby said. \"So really it's been a huge ongoing debate as to whether you should use steroids in patients with viral respiratory diseases.\"\n\nThe researchers said on Tuesday that they think this now should become a standard of care in the United Kingdom for Covid-19 patients requiring either oxygen or ventilation -- but in the meantime, the Recovery Trial continues to investigate other treatment approaches.\n\n'This is a ground-breaking development'\n\n\"This is tremendous news today from the Recovery trial showing that dexamethasone is the first drug to reduce mortality from COVID-19. It is particularly exciting as this is an inexpensive widely available medicine,\" Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK Government's chief scientific adviser, said in a news release from the Recovery Trial team on Tuesday.\n\n\"This is a ground-breaking development in our fight against the disease, and the speed at which researchers have progressed finding an effective treatment is truly remarkable,\" Vallance said. \"It shows the importance of doing high quality clinical trials and basing decisions on the results of those trials.\"\n\nNick Cammack, the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator lead at Wellcome Trust in the UK, said in a written statement on Tuesday that the dexamethasone findings are a \"major breakthrough.\"\n\n\"This is a major breakthrough: dexamethasone is the first and only drug that has made a significant difference to patient mortality for COVID-19. Potentially preventing 1 death in every 8 ventilated patients would be remarkable,\" Cammack said in the statement.\n\n\"Finding effective treatments like this will transform the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lives and economies across the world. While this study suggests dexamethasone only benefits severe cases, countless lives will be saved globally,\" Cammack said in part. \"Dexamethasone must now be rolled out and accessed by thousands of critically ill patients around the world.

Asa Hutchinson.\n\n\"We can't have life on hold for six months to a year until there's a vaccination,\" said Hutchinson. \"We have to be able to carry on life and business.\"\n\nNorth Carolina's next steps are not yet clear as the state sees positive rates of tests and hospitalizations. Gov. Roy Cooper told reporters Monday that he would announce early next week whether the state will still open under phase three later this month.\n\nThe city of Austin, Texas, has already taken action, extending stay home orders through August 15, Mayor Steve Adler tweeted Monday.\n\nThere has been a rise in cases of coronavirus in the city, Adler said. Meanwhile, Texas reported a record high of 2,326 hospitalizations due to coronavirus on Monday.\n\nNew Jersey is among the states with the lowest trend in new cases in the country, but Gov. Phil Murphy said that does not equal clearance to throw out precautions.\n\n\"We're not just going to throw up our doors all at once as other states have done,\" Murphy said. \"We've already paid a huge, huge almost unfathomable price.\"\n\nWho is getting sick\n\nA new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sheds some light on the demographic breakdown of who is getting sick with the virus in the US and how they have fared.\n\nOf the 1,761,503 cases of coronavirus between January 22 and May 30, 14% were hospitalized, 2% were admitted to the intensive care unit and 5% died.\n\nThe latest figures confirm that older people, minorities and those with preexisting health conditions are at highest risk of death.\n\nGlobally, about one in five people have an underlying health condition that put them at increased risk of getting severely ill from coronavirus, according to a study published in the journal Lancet Global Health on Monday.\n\nMany of those may have conditions that have not been diagnosed or are not known to the health system, the researchers, from institutions around the world including the United Kingdom, United States and China, wrote in the study.\n\nLearning more about the virus\n\nHealth professionals are hoping to protect people from the virus by learning more about it.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health launched a national database to collect medical information on US coronavirus patients to learn more.\n\n\"This effort aims to transform clinical information into knowledge urgently needed to study COVID-19, including health risk factors that indicate better or worse outcomes of the disease, and identify potentially effective treatments,\" the agency said in a news release Monday.\n\nTo help inform the public about if they have been exposed to the virus, the Red Cross announced Monday that it will be testing all blood, plasma and platelet donations for coronavirus antibodies.\n\nThe test, which has been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, shows whether a person's immune system has produced antibodies to fight the virus.\n\nChildren were once thought to not be as likely to have a difficult fight with the virus, but a team at Northwell Health, a large New York health system, said that a condition called Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) may be a delayed response to a coronavirus infection.\n\n\"We were pretty shocked as it was playing out,\" Dr. Charles Schleien told CNN on Monday. \"The whole syndrome came out of the blue.

In fact, doing workouts like this that uses the whole body has improved aerobic fitness and muscle strength in young sedentary females, according to research\n\nSo even if you only fit this into your schedule a few times a week, the shorter bursts of a circuit workout like this one will still have a positive impact on your body.\n\nBy taking minimal rest time in between exercises, you're accomplishing a cardiovascular workout even while doing strength-training exercises. Wherever and however you decide to incorporate the family, you'll speed up your heart rate and firm up your muscles.\n\nPut yourself through the paces of this routine the next time you're watching your kids play outside. Or have them join in on the fun so that while one person does one exercise, another person does the next exercise, and so on. After completing your exercise, you move on to the next one.\n\nMonkey bar moves\n\nTricep dips: This move works the muscles in the shoulders, arms, back and core, just as swinging from monkey bars would. You can perform these tricep dips and modified push-ups on a curb, step or bench.\n\nTo start, find a step or curb and sit down on it. Place your hands on the step behind you and bend your knees. Walk your feet forward so that your legs are straight out in front of you and the heels are on the ground. Keep your back straight up and down.\n\nBend the elbows to lower yourself down toward the ground and then press down through your hands to come up. This works the backs of your arms (the triceps). Repeat 10 times.\n\nPush-ups: Then, stand up and face the step. Place your hands on the step as wide as your shoulders and walk your feet out away from the step into a push-up position.\n\nPull the naval in toward the spine and bend the elbows out to the sides to lower your chest toward the ground.\n\nThen press down through the hands to come up to the starting position. Repeat this 10 times.\n\nClimbing up the slide\n\nMountain climbers: Kids love climbing up slides \u2014 which is a similar body movement to mountain climbers on the grass, sidewalk or driveway.\n\nPlace your hands on the ground with your shoulders over your wrists. Next place your feet on the ground with your butt up in the air. Step your right foot forward in between your hands, and then step it back. Step your left foot forward in between your hands, and then step it back.\n\nRepeat this quickly 20 times so that it almost becomes as fast as a run.\n\nLet's swing without the set\n\nSwinging double-toe taps: At the playground, swings are a favorite activity. But if you don't have a swing set, you can still do swinging double-toe taps as an ab exercise while sitting on a step or curb.\n\nSit down and bend your knees. Squeeze your legs and inner thighs together. Lift your feet up off of the ground and pull your naval in toward your spine. You may lean back slightly.\n\nBring your knees up as high as you can, and then slowly lower them down to tap your toes on the ground. Repeat 20 times.\n\nJump up on the slide\n\nModified box jumps: Out on the playground, children may jump up onto a slide or park bench. Similarly, at a gym, you'd likely see a box that's a few feet high and you'd work to jump up onto the box.

From the late 1930s, the North American country had also started to manufacture British-designed planes for the Allied war effort. Many of these planes were iconic wartime designs like the Hawker Hurricane fighter and Avro Lancaster bomber.\n\nAmbitious Canadian politicians and engineers weren\u2019t satisfied with this. They decided to forge a world-leading aircraft manufacturing industry out of the factories and skilled workforce built up during the war. Tired of manufacturing aircraft designed by others, this new generation of Canadian leaders were determined to produce Canadian designs. Avro Aircraft, the Canadian airplane maker created after the war, was the company that would deliver their dream.\n\nFreed from the set ways-of-thinking of Avro\u2019s more established rivals, the firm\u2019s engineers were able to work on revolutionary jet fighters, commercial airliners, flying saucers and even a space plane. They placed Canada at the technological cutting edge of the new Jet Age.\n\nIn so doing, these engineers challenged notions of what small countries like Canada could achieve in the hi-tech industries of the day, even if convincing politicians to stump up the cash for them was an altogether trickier business.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nThen came the Arrow. On 4 October 1957, 14,000 people watched a large hangar on the outskirts of Toronto open to reveal a beautiful, large, white, delta-wing aircraft. The plane was the Avro Arrow interceptor. A third longer and broader than today\u2019s Eurofighter Typhoon, the Arrow could fly close to Mach 2.0 (1,500 mph, or the maximum speed of Concorde), and had the potential to fly even faster. It was Canada\u2019s Can$250m (US$1,58bn today) bid to become an aviation superpower.\n\nThe project was genuinely ground-breaking. Avro\u2019s engineers had been allowed to build a record-breaker without compromise. But Canadians would soon discover that the supersonic age had made aviation projects so expensive that only a handful of countries could carry them out \u2013 and Canada, unfortunately, wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nThe advert for Avro Aircraft celebrating the \u201cfirst 50 years of powered flight in Canada 1909\u20131959\u201d had only just been printed when on \u201cBlack Friday\u201d, 20 February 1959, the loudspeaker of the Avro Aircraft factory on the outskirts of Toronto crackled to life. Thousands of workers heard the company president announce \u201cthat f------ prick in Ottawa\u201d (the newly elected Canadian prime minister John Diefenbaker) had cancelled the entire Arrow programme.

However, St Mary\u2019s hospital on the Isle of Wight rejected repeated pleas by them for doctors to help him, even though his health was deteriorating sharply.\n\nThe man, who does not want to be named, said his experience of seeking NHS care for something other than Covid-19 during the pandemic had been \u201cdebilitating and exhausting\u201d and that feeling the NHS \u201cwas not there\u201d for him had been \u201cvery distressing\u201d for him and his wife.\n\nMary Smith, of the solicitors Novum Law, who are representing the man in his complaint against the trust, said his plight highlighted the growing number of cases that were emerging of people whose health had suffered because they could not access normal NHS care in recent months.\n\n\u201cIt is evident in this case that something went badly wrong and our client was failed by the system. The NHS was designed to offer \u2018cradle to the grave\u2019 medical treatment for all, yet our client was not able to access urgent treatment when he needed it,\u201d said Smith.\n\nThe man\u2019s wife said: \u201cNot only was my husband sent home when he shouldn\u2019t have been, but no matter how hard we tried, neither we, our GP or the paramedics could arrange for a hospital to take him.\n\n\u201cBy the time an NHS 111 doctor insisted he go straight to the hospital he was so unwell [that] his life was in danger.\n\n\u201cIf the hospital had got the diagnosis right in the first place, or not discharged him when they cleared the ward on the day of the lockdown, all this would never have happened.\u201d\n\nHer husband was admitted to St Mary\u2019s on 22 March with pain in his abdomen and groin from a flare-up of an existing hernia problem. The next morning he was scanned but then sent home after doctors wrongly diagnosed his condition as having inflamed testicles. They told him to take antibiotics.\n\nHe said he was one of many patients who were also discharged that day.\n\nIn the following weeks St Mary\u2019s hospital had refused to readmit him, despite his symptoms worsening. The man\u2019s wife rang 10 private hospitals on the mainland but all had said they could not treat her husband as they had been taken over by the NHS as part of a deal to provide extra NHS care during the pandemic.\n\nIn desperation she rang 999 on 12 April. But staff at St Mary\u2019s told the ambulance crew not to bring him in and instead to tell him to ring NHS 111. He was finally readmitted later that day when the NHS 111 doctor who answered his call recognised how serious the situation was. He was then diagnosed as having appendicitis within his hernia, sepsis and necrotising fasciitis.\n\nAn inquiry by the trust found that \u201cthere was a missed diagnosis on 22 March\u201d. The patient had to spend three weeks in hospital after he was readmitted, but infection control procedures at St Mary\u2019s to reduce the spread of the coronavirus meant his wife was not allowed to visit.\n\nIn a letter to the patient acknowledging that mistakes were made, Isle of Wight NHS trust\u2019s chief executive, Maggie Oldham, apologised and said: \u201cThe trust accepts that had surgery on the right inguinal hernia been undertaken during the admission of 22 to 23 March 2020 the subsequent pain, sepsis and numerous returns to theatre would have been avoided.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Isle of Wight trust said: \u201cWe sincerely apologise for the experience that this person had in our care, following a misdiagnosis in March 2020 that resulted in the patient having to spend a long time in hospital during April and May. The changes to the hospital environment as a result of Covid-19 are in place to protect those in our care and we have not discharged patients early who require continued hospital treatment.\u201d\n\nPeter Walsh, the chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents (AvMA), said he believed that the trust was the first to admit that patients\u2019 health had suffered as a result of hospitals across the UK urgently reorganising services to prioritise the fight against Covid-19. The charity was now hearing of many similar cases.\n\nNHS England, hospital bosses, health charities and AvMA are voicing increasing concern that some of the many millions of patients who have missed out on diagnosis or care during the pandemic, including those with cancer and heart problems, will experience health declines.\n\nNiall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS providers of care, last week warned: \u201cThe virus has inflicted pain and suffering throughout the UK. But we also know the measures to combat it have come at a terrible cost to those who have not been able to access the care, treatment and support they need and to many whose conditions have gone undiagnosed.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian reported last week how Sherwin Hall, a 27-year-old delivery driver in Leeds, was fighting for his life after his cancer spread from his pelvis during March, April and May when he could not get a scan.\n\nThe leader of England\u2019s surgeons on Tuesday warned that it would be \u201cfour or five years\u201d before the NHS could again give people non-urgent surgery within the target of 18 weeks. Prof Derek Alderson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, also told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee that the NHS should continue using private hospitals to help tackle the big backlog of care that had built up because of the suspension of normal care.\n\nIf there was a second wave of Covid-19, patients needing cancer surgery, a cataract removal or hip or knee replacement could potentially have their operations in one of the Nightingale hospitals, which were built to help with the pandemic but quickly mothballed, he added."}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/16/cafe-society-returns-to-paris-pavement-bars-bistros", "published": "2020-06-16T16:29:52", "title": "Cafe society returns to Paris as bars and bistros spill out on the pavements", "author": ["John Brunton"], "text": "On a normal weekend, rue d\u2019Aligre, near Place de la Bastille in Paris\u2019s 12th arrondissement, is lined with raucous fruit and vegetable stalls and packed with shoppers and tourists heading for the historic March\u00e9 d\u2019Aligre at its northern end.

So it is a little strange sitting here today without him and his golden retriever, Hugo, surrounded by all these extra tables, everyone eating, drinking and celebrating as if nothing had happened. I understand that cafes need to make money again quickly, but I think you will soon see tensions in the summer with families trying to push prams or disabled people having to zigzag along a narrow pavement packed with tables of noisy diners.\u201d\n\nThe owner of nearby wine bar Le Siffleur de Ballons, Denis Teixeira, smiles when he hears this. \u201cI actually signed the contract to buy this bar \u00e0 vin just before lockdown, and Monday was the first day I have been able to open bottles for customers. Sure there will be problems sorting out the practicalities of pavement tables, but just imagine what a wonderful opportunity it is, not just for locals but for the tourists who will hopefully return over the summer, to enjoy the unique pleasure of sitting out on a sunny day, eating and drinking on a cafe terrace in the heart of our city.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/16/weve-been-forced-into-debt-jobless-life-in-the-uk-under-lockdown", "published": "2020-06-16T15:53:36", "title": "'We've been forced into debt' \u2013 jobless life in the UK under lockdown", "author": ["Mattha Busby"], "text": "Four workers describe how they\u2019ve coped since losing their jobs as the pandemic hit\n\nUK unemployment is expected to climb over the next few months from one of the lowest in the developed world, at 3.9%, to a much higher level.

Face coverings have also been recommended more widely, including in Scotland, in cases where social distancing is difficult.\n\n\u201cThe main issue is that people who are deaf and have hearing loss rely heavily on visual clues for effective communication \u2013 that includes body language, gestures, facial expression and lip-reading,\u201d said Ayla Ozmen, head of research and policy at Action on Hearing Loss. \u201cBritish sign language (BSL) users also rely heavily on seeing lip patterns as well as facial expressions to understand BSL.\u201d\n\nWhile those who are travelling on public transport in England with someone who relies on lip-reading are exempt from wearing face coverings, something Action on Hearing Loss welcomed, Ozmen said little had been done to publicise this, raising concerns that those legitimately not wearing masks may face abuse.\n\nAnd there are other problems, Ozmen said, noting the rules around masks and face coverings in hospitals come into conflict with the accessible information standard, which puts an obligation on health and social care providers to meet people\u2019s communications needs.\n\nQ&A Coronavirus: should everyone be wearing face masks? Show Hide People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask. The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used. The WHO says masks should be made of three layers \u2013 with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations. The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers. Sarah Boseley Health editor\n\n\u201cThere has been no guidance from the government on how to handle that conflict in both health settings and social care settings,\u201d she said, adding that with more than 70% of people over 70 having hearing loss, many people admitted to hospital with coronavirus may experience difficulties in communication.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely understand the public health need for wearing PPE but there is also a really significant concern, a safety concern, if people aren\u2019t able to communicate,\u201d said Ozmen.\n\nHolly Parker, an 18-year-old from Essex who is profoundly deaf and largely relies on lip reading, said she had encountered problems as a result of face coverings.\n\n\u201cMy main method of communication is taken away. In shops I am no longer able to understand shopkeepers and this causes me a lot of anxiety,\u201d she said, adding that she was deeply worried about the prospect of going to university if face masks had to be used during practical lessons.\n\nDeaf charities, including Action on Hearing Loss, said they welcomed the development of transparent masks, something Parker and others said would make life easier if widely used.\n\nPhilip Gerrard, chief executive at Deaf Action, said the charity had been testing several prototypes of transparent face masks within the deaf community and hoped it would shortly roll these out to members of staff, clients and the wider community.\n\n\u201cWe would also like to see the government support the development of deaf-friendly face masks that are PPE approved in hospitals and care settings throughout the UK,\u201d he said.\n\nIan Noon, head of policy at the National Deaf Children\u2019s Society, agreed, adding: \u201cIn the meantime, if people pick up some deaf awareness tips like being patient, writing things down or using gestures if a deaf person needs them to, this would also have a big impact.\u201d\n\nThe deafness, cognition and language research centre at University College London also issued a statement calling for greater awareness of the challenges around hearing difficulties and face masks, but said transparent face shields were a better solution, because they let the whole face be seen.\n\nBut, it added, dialogue with deaf communities was crucial, noting: \u201cDeaf and hard-of-hearing people are best placed to advise on design needs and ensure any products are fit for purpose.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/16/greggs-reopen-stores-sales-coronavirus-crisis", "published": "2020-06-16T10:26:34", "title": "Greggs to reopen 800 stores on Thursday but warns of lower sales", "author": ["Kalyeena Makortoff"], "text": "Greggs is pressing ahead with plans to reopen 800 stores on Thursday but has said it expects sales to be lower than normal for some time, prompting the bakery chain to suspend plans to open new stores and seek rent reductions from its landlords.\n\nThe Newcastle-based chain, which has 2,050 shops, is planning to reopen the remainder of its stores in early July, with Covid-19 safety measures in place such as protective screens at its counters and markings to help ensure customers maintain physical distancing.\n\n\u201cWe are not able to predict the impact of social distancing on our ability to trade or on customer demand,\u201d Greggs said in a market update on Tuesday. \u201cHowever, our capacity to operate will be restricted by size of shop and we must anticipate that sales may be lower than normal for some time.\u201d\n\nThe bakery, which usually sells about 1.5m sausage rolls a week and last year successfully launched a vegan alternative, said it had informed all of its landlords that it would be moving to monthly rather than quarterly rental payment and was making a \u201cvariety of proposals\u201d in return for rent reductions.\n\nA \u201cproportion\u201d of Greggs\u2019 25,000 staff will remain on full or partial furlough until sales levels \u201cbegin to return to normal\u201d, the company said.\n\nThat will include workers at its manufacturing sites, as Greggs continues to limit its food range to the bakery\u2019s best-selling items. \u201cTherefore a number of our manufacturing operational teams will remain furloughed until demand reaches a level that justifies the addition of remaining product lines,\u201d Greggs said.\n\nThe company is also suspending plans for new shop openings but said it would follow through with about 60 new stores, due in part to legal commitments.

We have several reports yesterday, and this morning, where parents have shown up to playgrounds to cut the locks on them. These are specifically in Williamsburg and in other areas of Brooklyn. You\u2019ve gotten questions about this in the past where there\u2019s some frustration that the playgrounds are not opening up yet. They say they are going against your orders, and cutting these locks open. So, your reaction to that \u2014 and is the city going to show up and close them again, and are you going to have to clean them up? What is the process here? A: We are not going to allow people to take the law into their own hands. It just doesn\u2019t work. So people are not allowed to open up a playground that is not yet available to the public. It is for a reason. Look, I was very sympathetic in the beginning, to every parent, as a parent myself, why people wanted to be on those playgrounds. We tried to make it work. It wasn\u2019t working effectively. Right now, we are not going to make a change with the playgrounds until we get to phase two. Now, Phase Two, as everyone knows, could be as early as June 22nd. I\u2019ve said I think it\u2019s going to take a little longer than that just to make sure we are absolutely certain. But until the order is given that playgrounds are open, people need to stay off the playgrounds. It is not appropriate to take their own action. We are doing this so we can get to Phase Two and beyond. So I understand people\u2019s frustrations. But if folks act prematurely and that causes the disease to start spreading again, then that\u2019s the kind of thing that undermines our ability to get to Phase Two, and stay in Phase Two. So, I know it is not easy. But people have to understand, there\u2019s a reason for these rules \u2014 it is to help us move forward.\n\nHe did not explain why he, along with tens of thousands of other left-wing New Yorkers, marched in Black Lives Matter protests or protests on behalf of black transgender people, where social distancing rules were generally not observed.\n\nJoel B.

It\u2019s about the rule of law\u2026 It\u2019s about what comes next\u2026\n\nLocal communities should be allowed to erect or remove whatever statues, monuments, and street names they like. If Seattle wants to erect a statue of Vladimir Lenin (and it does), a cold-blooded murderer and Hitler-like antisemite and tyrant, so be it. What the hell do I care?\n\nIf some southern town or city wants to erect a statue of Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis or Stonewall Jackson, what the hell do I care?\n\nAnd if, someday, Seattle or that southern town or city decides to removes those statues \u2014 again, what the hell do I care?\n\nOther than the sense of history, I feel no affinity towards the Confederacy. A few decades ago, when the left claimed the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery (this is when the left\u2019s agenda was to deny white Americans fought a war to free the slaves), I was arguing that was ridiculous. Granted, not everyone who fought for the Confederacy fought to protect the abomination of slavery (including Robert E. Lee).\n\nIn fact, many who fought for the Confederacy opposed slavery (including Robert E. Lee). But of course the war was fought over slavery. And although the left currently agrees with me on that issue, it only does as a means to justify its rationale to Taliban these statues.\n\nSame with the Confederate flag. If it was up for a vote, I would have voted to remove the Confederate flag from South Carolina\u2019s capitol, and I was glad when then-Gov. Nikki Haley (R-SC) removed it in 2015. It made no sense to me to fly that flag in the present tense at a state capitol, and an elected official like Haley removing it, someone with the legal power to do so, someone accountable to the voters, means it was removed in the right way.\n\nAt the same time, I know the Confederate flag doesn\u2019t mean \u201cbring back slavery\u201d to those who fly it. It means freedom from centralized authority, it means live and let live\u2026 I live in the South where I\u2019ve seen more than one black person sporting the Stars and Bars\u2026 Hey, is this a great country, or what?\n\nRobert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant were great men and great Americans. Abraham Lincoln might be the greatest American ( Jefferson Davis was a feckless, self-aggrandizing putz). Rev. Martin Luther King is a hero of mine, but so is Malcolm X, and so is Thomas Jefferson. What can I say? People are complicated. But all these men had one thing in common\u2026 They believed in freedom, and they fought for freedom, and while I never would have joined the Confederacy or the Nation of Islam, I\u2019m also not a baby about this stuff.\n\nSpeaking of babies\u2026\n\nThere is a valid and legal process by which to have an offending statue removed. And I respect anyone who goes about that process. Regardless of my personal belief, the law is the law is the law\u2026The principle of the rule of law and the equal application of that rule is much more important to me than my personal opinion of a statue or cause.\n\nBut we are so far beyond the law now\u2026 We\u2019re at a place where Democrats, along with the corporate media, academia, and even some historians, are championing gangsters and howling mobs tearing down and desecrating statues and monuments.\n\nThat\u2019s what I oppose, that\u2019s what sickens me, and I would oppose it if mobs targeted Seattle\u2019s repulsive Lenin statue.\n\nThe very institutions that should be standing up for the rule of law \u2014 Democrats, the corporate media, academia, and historians \u2014 are applauding and excusing mob rule, vandalism, property damage, and violence.\n\nThose of us who oppose this appalling behavior, not just on the grounds of criminality, but who believe we should not hide our warts-and-all history, who understand that some of these Confederate monuments were erected with the best of intentions \u2014 to heal our country \u2014 are attacked as racists defending racists. And it is this argument that tells you what the Woke Taliban intend to next tear down\u2026 Which is another reason to oppose this lawlessness, even if you want Confederate statues to come down\u2026\n\nBecause \u201cracism\u201d is the rationale of the Woke Taliban\u2019s lawlessness and those who applaud and defend them, then nothing is safe from this lawlessness. Any monument to our Founding Fathers is eventually doomed to these mobs and vandals (this has already begun), and then they will come for the Christian Church \u2014 a Church the media and left have spent decades smearing as racist and homophobic.\n\nAnd then what? What comes down next?\n\nIt\u2019s no secret what\u2019s next\u2026\n\nThe answers are here and here.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

How do you balance it with freedom of speech? If you\u2019ve got a law, for example, saying that using someone\u2019s preferred pronoun is mandatory \u2014 or you can be fined [for non-compliance], how do we balance that with some of these other important and even constitutional questions? Those are things that, for the most part, are unfortunately going to be just decided by a whole range of lower courts. and it will be a long time before the Supreme Court even takes up the opportunity to weigh in on that.\u201d\n\nSeverino predicted, \u201cThese questions are going to create a tsunami of new litigation and create a huge amount of uncertainty going forward.\u201d\n\nLISTEN:\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision to extend prohibitions against employment discrimination to include sexual orientation and \u201cgender identity\u201d will place religious and traditional organizations at a legal disadvantage when they are inevitably sued by left-wing outfits.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see these decisions going overwhelmingly in favor of the litigants [and] the plaintiffs who are challenging any religious organization, or any school, or anyone who wants to maintain a traditional, biologically based, scientific-based understanding of sex,\u201d Severino forecasted.\n\n\u201cThe logic that the court embraced\u201d sets in motion a legal momentum for lower courts to render future decisions in favor of plaintiffs suing religious and traditional organizations for their personnel decisions, Severino anticipated.\n\nMansour asked if religious organizations would surrender to left-wing activist groups filing lawsuits based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision given their insufficient resources to legally defend themselves.\n\nSeverino replied, \u201cThat\u2019s part of the strategy of the activists because they know that many of these organizations can\u2019t afford to pay for defense. They can\u2019t afford to risk a negative judgment where they could face crippling fines. If you\u2019re talking about individuals, you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened with cases like the Masterpiece Cake Shop case, where someone\u2019s entire business and livelihood could be destroyed and where they can face even personal threats and real concern over their own safety if they are willing to carry on litigation.\u201d\n\nSeverino added, \u201cI think the intimidation factor of a lawsuit is huge, and when you\u2019ve got the court almost inviting that, it\u2019s going to present a real challenge for a lot of people. Practically speaking, for the most part, this isn\u2019t even going to be an issue because I think there\u2019s the vast majority of businesses don\u2019t have any reason or desire to discriminate on either of these bases, but there are circumstances where it is either relevant to the job qualifications or where it\u2019s going to be an issue of conscience, and those are the ones where you\u2019re going to have people who are going to be forced to make those tough choices between violating their own conscience and possibly losing their livelihood.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision amounted to a rewriting of civil rights legislation, Severino stated.\n\n\u201cThis had to do with the court interpreting the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d Severino explained. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of familiar with this language. It says that no employers can discriminate on the basis of sex, of religion, of natural origin, and other kinds of classic caveats that you have, but what their question was, \u2018It says you can\u2019t discriminate ion the basis of sex. Does that also mean you can\u2019t discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity?'\u201d\n\nSeverino continued, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a strange question to be asking because in so many states, now, and in many situations in federal law, we already do have laws preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation, but they never phrase it as \u2018discrimination based on sex.\u2019 It\u2019s always explicitly written, \u2018discrimination based on sexual orientation.'\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the Supreme Court did is, in an opinion, they basically just rewrote what that text said because there is a long-standing history where for decades, no politicians [and] no judge said that language meant sexual orientation, as well,\u201d Severino added.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision usurps the role of legislators, Severino determined.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really a revisionist reading of the statute dressed up as textualism, and that\u2019s one of the things that is so dangerous because we have laws that courts can effectively rewrite,\u201d Severino concluded. \u201cNo legislator who passed [Title VII of the Civil Rights Act] would have thought it meant that.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\n\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2020/06/15/carrie-severino-scotus-lgbt-decision-tsunami-litigation-religious-groups/", "published": "2020-06-15T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Listen: Slamming Boris, Farage Teases Return to Front Line Politics", "author": ["Oliver Jj Lane"], "text": "Now may be the time to take on Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cabject\u201d leadership head-on, Nigel Farage told Breitbart News, as rumours swirl about his plans to activate the planned Reform Party and return to front-line politics.\n\nNigel Farage revealed to Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM Patriot on Monday that, amidst the speculation, he was certainly considering a return to front-line politics. As the British political establishment once again finds itself in a state of confused paralysis, Mr Farage said he could give it a \u201cgood kicking politically\u201d.\n\nBritish press speculated at the weekend that Mr Farage was on the verge of activating the Reform Party, a name he registered with the government\u2019s electoral commission last year but has kept dormant. In light of those reports, Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow asked the Brexit leader what was coming next.\n\nWhile Mr Farage sidestepped answering the question directly, he made clear that present UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was severely underperforming and something would have to be done. He told Breitbart News: \u201cBoris\u2019s leadership has been abject. There is one mitigating factor, which is, of course, is that he was very seriously ill just a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cHe could have died \u2014 we need to understand that\u2026 [but] It would seem with coronavirus we were too slow into lockdown, and we\u2019re too slow out of lockdown. On China, he still seems to think Huawei is acceptable having some sort of role within our 5G system. At every level, Boris is not providing proper leadership.\u201d\n\nOn his track record, Mr Farage admitted there was a precedent of him coming out of semi-retirement to force political change. He said: \u201cNow, of course, people remember that having done my bit with UKIP, having got the referendum, having helped to win it, I did come back last year to try and save the situation with the Brexit Party because the Tories had made such a mess of it. There\u2019s a level of media speculation which says: \u2018Nigel is going to come back again and give the establishment a good kicking politically.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll I will say is: let\u2019s watch, let\u2019s wait, let\u2019s see. I haven\u2019t yet decided that the time is right, but it may be.\u201d\n\nAbbott to Farage: Bojo Needs His \u2018Mojo\u2019, Must Start Sending Back Illegal Boat Migrants to France https://t.co/5M6nyiaJuw \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 2, 2020\n\nMr Farage last re-entered politics in early 2019 when Brexit was becalmed in the doldrums, its progress frustrated by years of mismanagement by Theresa May\u2019s government. He founded a new political party \u2014 the Brexit Party \u2014 and led it to victory in the national European Parliament election just six weeks later.\n\nAs Farage pushed the Conservative Party over target \u2014 and Theresa May out of office \u2014 it was taken over by Boris Johnson, who fought and won the December 2019 general election on a pro-Brexit platform. But just as Theresa May\u2019s government was not capable, by inclination, to deliver Brexit, so Boris Johnson\u2019s new government finds itself unequal to the \u2014 clearly unanticipated by them \u2014 culture wars suddenly sweeping Western nations.\n\nAs important historical monuments, including the statue of Winston Churchill, said to be Boris Johnson\u2019s hero and role model, were vandalised by hard-left activists, Downing Street remained silent. Mr Farage reflected in his Breitbart News Daily interview: \u201c\u2026it has taken him nearly ten days to properly condemn those who didn\u2019t just pull down a statue of somebody involved in the slave trade. They defaced, for two consecutive days, Winston Churchill\u2019s statue, and they even defaced our national war memorial, to the one and a half million killed in two world wars. And it has taken Boris ten days to properly respond.\u201d\n\nHaving won the Brexit wars for Britain, Mr Farage this week leaves the door open on the question of whether he will fight in its culture wars, too. He has certainly already skirmished on this matter, pointing to the hard-left Marxist programme of change being promoted by the Black Lives Matter UK organisation. As Breitbart London reported on Monday, Mr Farage was particularly clear on the threat to freedom of speech and freedom of thought.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart News, the Brexit leader reflected: \u201cIt seems that the real threat we face now is a genuine threat to free speech. I have never known a time when, in the United Kingdom \u2014 which is famed for its huge breadth of media commentary and views \u2014 I have never seen so many people so scared to write and say and speak and broadcast what they think.

Many such eateries are still closed, which means that around 4.5 million independent restaurant jobs have been lost due to the outbreak.\n\n\u201cIn fact, job losses in the restaurant industry account for more than a quarter of the increase to the US unemployment figures since February, figures that have not been seen since the Great Depression,\u201d the report notes.\n\nIndependent restaurants, unlike fast food chains, are highly dependent on dine-in revenue and thus have been hit particularly hard by the outbreak.\n\nThe closing down of as many as 85% of independent restaurants will also undeniably impact the American economy. According to the report, such establishments are a large part of the restaurant industry as a whole, which generates more than $760 billion in annual sales and employs millions of people across the US.\n\n\u201cWith millions of jobs at stake, the collapse of independent restaurants would ignite a downward economic spiral with ripple effects in other already hard-hit industries in the travel, hospitality and leisure sector that would be felt for years. Mass failure may also destabilize the commercial real estate market if these restaurants cannot pay rent, which could also incite a spillover effect in the larger economy,\u201d the report warns.\n\nTo ensure that independent restaurants survive the end of the year, the Independent Restaurant Coalition suggests that the federal government provide grants to such businesses through the Restaurant Stabilization Fund.\n\n\u201cSwift intervention with an infusion of $120 billion through the Restaurant Stabilization Fund (the \u2018Stabilization Fund\u2019 or the \u2018Fund\u2019) would give independent restaurants the ability, confidence, and incentive to re-hire employees and stay open (or re-open) \u2013 even at reduced capacity, when they would otherwise find it to be in their best interest to remain closed or only offer takeout,\u201d the report argues.\n\nThe Independent Restaurant Coalition predicts that the Stabilization Fund would lead to at least $248 billion in economic returns.\n\n\n\nAlex Jones is joined by investigative journalist Lee Stranahan to expose the parallels between the recent revolution in Ukraine and Black Lives Matter/Antifa race riots in the U.S.\n\nThe first-ever nascent iodine Survival Shield X-2 Spray is finally here!

South Korea's government said it would ban the activist groups from sending leaflets and asked the police last week to investigate them.\n\nThe liaison office, where officials from the two Koreas were able to communicate around-the-clock, had been temporarily closed since January due to concerns over the novel coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAD\n\nBut its destruction is a setback for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has made efforts to coax Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons and end deep-rooted hostilities between the rival Koreas the hallmarks of his presidency.

Then on Friday \u2014 the second anniversary of a historic Singapore summit between President Trump and her brother \u2014 North Korea issued another broadside: pledging to further bolster its military to counter threats from Washington.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement issued earlier this month, Kim Yo Jong complained bitterly about defectors scattering hundreds of leaflets across the border into North Korea, calling them \u201chuman scum little short of wild animals\u201d and \u201criffraff\u201d betraying their homeland.\n\n\u201cNow that the mongrel dogs are doing others harm, it is time to bring their owners to account,\u201d she added, threatening to sever ties with the South Korean government unless it cracked down on the defectors\u2019 pro-democracy activism.\n\n'Unusually high profile'\n\nRachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea analyst for the U.S. government, said North Korean state media gave Kim Yo Jong\u2019s statement an \u201cunusually high profile,\u201d even holding it up as a reference point in articles, rallies and people\u2019s reactions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis clearly was intended to give Kim Yo Jong more prominence than she \u2014 and probably any other non-Kim leader \u2014 had ever received,\u201d she said, adding that this has transformed her image from being the leader\u2019s sister into a policymaker in her own right.\n\nAD\n\nThat has reignited scrutiny about Kim Jong Un\u2019s health, after rumors swirled in April that he was gravely ill or had died. Kim reappeared in public in early May after an unexplained three-week absence, one of several prolonged withdrawals by him from the public eye this year.\n\nAndrei Lankov, an Asia scholar and professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, noted that Kim Jong Un has appeared in state media only three times since April 11, once in public, and twice in closed-door meetings, while also not signing official documents at his usual pace.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong with Kim Jong Un\u2019s health,\u201d he argued. \u201cAnd at such times, it\u2019s important to have a deputy. And who can be such deputy? Someone who is unlikely to take all power for himself or herself.\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s father and grandfather had elevated siblings into senior positions, and Lankov said Kim Jong Un appeared to be doing the same \u2014 particularly because his children are still young.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an established tradition within the Kim family, when your future successor is a bit too young, you just take your sibling because your sibling is reliable, and probably not going to betray you,\u201d he said.\n\nNo sign Kim Jong Un is ill\n\nBruce Klingner, a North Asia expert at the Heritage Foundation, agreed that Kim Yo Jong\u2019s elevation could be related to concerns about her brother\u2019s health. Kim Jong Il\u2019s stroke in 2008 spurred the leader to prepare his son Kim Jong Un for power.\n\nAD\n\nBut Klingner noted that there is no evidence that Kim Jong Un\u2019s absences were because of ill health. South Korea says it thinks the North Korean leader has simply been sheltering from the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cSince his return, Kim has seemed vibrant rather than frail, though, of course, not the picture of health, and he remains morbidly obese,\u201d Klingner said.\n\nAD\n\nSome experts said Kim Yo Jong\u2019s hard-line comments could be viewed as an attempt to bolster her credibility within the regime. But others said it may simply reflect shifting priorities within North Korea.\n\nWhen the North Korean regime felt threatened by the Trump administration and wanted to dial down tensions, Kim Yo Jong visited South Korea for the Winter Olympics in 2018 and presented a friendlier, less-menacing image for the regime.\n\nAD\n\nNow North Korea appears to want more concessions from South Korea by amping up the threat level, Lankov said, and Kim\u2019s sister is presenting quite a different picture to the world.\n\n'Dark nightmare'\n\nPark Jie-won, who served as a South Korean envoy to Pyongyang during the government of president Kim Dae-jung, said he met Kim Yo Yong last June. She came to the border village of Panmunjom to offer condolences on the death of the late president Kim\u2019s widow.\n\nAD\n\nHe said her elevation would simplify inter-Korean dialogue because she had direct access to her brother.\n\nPark said he was not worried about Kim Yo Jong\u2019s rhetorical attack on South Korea, which he said was aimed at her domestic audience.\n\nAD\n\nYet his optimism is not widely shared.\n\nOn Tuesday, North Korea announced that it was closing telephone ties with the South, and on Friday, it issued a fierce denunciation of the United States.\n\nHope for improved relations had been high during the Singapore summit in 2018, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon, but this has given way to \u201cdespair characterized by spiraling deterioration.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven a slim ray of optimism for peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d he said, \u201chas faded away into a dark nightmare.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/06/16/theres-loophole-along-closed-us-canada-border-couples-are-getting-married-there/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-06-16T12:00:03", "title": "There\u2019s a loophole along the closed U.S.-Canada border.

For months, it was a strange and dusty meetup spot where couples would go to see each other and would often notice others doing the same.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeeting this way was painful, Bosello said, \u201cbut it was still better than nothing.\u201d\n\nAs the weather warmed and shutdowns lifted, a superior reunion spot emerged in mid-May: Peace Arch Park. There, cross-national couples and families could actually embrace \u2014 at long last.\n\nThe recently reopened park is situated between Blaine, Wash., and Surrey, B.C.\n\n\u201cWhen I finally hugged him again, it felt like it was the first time I ever did,\u201d Bosello said.\n\nIn fact, the couple, who has been together for five years, was so ecstatic to reunite, they took a huge relationship leap. On June 6, they gathered a small group of family and friends and got married.\n\n\u201cBeing separated made us realize what\u2019s truly important to us,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe circumstances we found ourselves in really highlighted that we wanted to make it official.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe couple ordered silicone rings online to use as temporary wedding bands, and Bosello wore a navy dress she had ordered for a friend\u2019s wedding \u2014 paired with sneakers.\n\n\u201cIt was all very casual and improvised,\u201d Bosello said. \u201cBut it was such a wonderful day, and so nice to just turn off everything else going on in the world.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who meet at the park daily, is hoping their marriage will speed up the process of Smith becoming a permanent Canadian resident, for which he submitted an application nearly two years ago.\n\nSmith is originally from Beltsville, Md., and was serving in the military in South Korea when he met Bosello, who was temporarily working abroad as a teacher.\n\nAD\n\nBosello moved home to Canada three weeks after the couple hit it off at a bar in Seoul, and they\u2019ve been in a long-distance relationship ever since. She stayed in Vancouver while Smith moved to Seattle and finally to Blaine.\n\nAD\n\nThe couple would see each other regularly because the drive between their respective homes is only about 40 minutes.\n\n\u201cFor a while, the distance was very manageable,\u201d Bosello said. \u201cThen the pandemic hit.\u201d\n\nThey are not the only couple who had the idea to tie the knot at the border.\n\nBefore the park reopened, Liz Peters\u2019s parents drove seven hours from Portland, Ore., to celebrate her wedding along 0 Avenue, while still standing on American soil. The couple married nearby and met her parents right after to celebrate because they couldn\u2019t be at the ceremony.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very close with my parents and could never imagine them not being there on my wedding day,\u201d said Peters, 27, who lives in Abbotsford, B.C.\n\nBut as word started getting out about the lucky loophole at Peace Arch Park, lovesick Americans and Canadians began showing up there to be together.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe day after Smith and Bosello tied the knot, Ryan Hamilton, 26, and Savannah Koop, 25, did, too.\n\nKoop, a Canadian, and her American husband also met regularly along 0 Avenue before the park reopened, each with their own coffee and snacks, for weekly date nights.\n\n\u201cIt was so hard to be so close yet so far,\u201d Koop said.\n\nWhen the couple heard the park reopened, they also decided to make their love official in the only place they could be together, after their original wedding was canceled because of the pandemic.\n\nThis spontaneous ceremony, they said, was even more special after their time apart.\n\nThe park is considered equal parts American and Canadian \u2014 a shared territory for citizens of both countries to visit. The southern half is owned by Washington State Parks, while the northern half is owned by British Columbia Provincial Parks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEntryways from both the American and Canadian sides are patrolled, and the park itself is surveilled to ensure no one exits the wrong side. But as long as visitors stay within the 42-acre area, they are permitted to roam freely throughout the grounds. According to the park\u2019s website, it is a space that is \u201cdevoted to peace and serenity.\u201d\n\nChelsea Horner, 30, who is in the midst of an American immigration process, took a ferry with her two kids from Canada to meet her husband, who is based on Whidbey Island, Wash.\n\n\u201cAnything is worth it to be able to see the person you love and unite your family,\u201d she said.\n\nThe couple, who normally commute back and forth, have plans to meet at the park again for Father\u2019s Day this weekend.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to couples, it\u2019s been an important meeting spot for other loved ones.\n\nAD\n\nKylie Hults, 34, visits with her parents at the park. She drives two hours from Brenton, Wash., while her folks travel 10 minutes from the Canadian border.\n\nHults, who is an only child, said this time together has been very important for her parents during the pandemic.\n\nFor them, and many others, Peace Arch Park is \u201cthe happiest place on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the Disneyland of the Pacific Northwest,\u201d said Erik Buddingh, 33.\n\nThe Canadian man ventured to the park to reunite with his American girlfriend, who flew from Indiana to Seattle and then drove to the border for a few stolen hours with him.\n\n\u201cThe park is filled with grandparents meeting their grandchildren for the first time, families reuniting after being divided by the border closure, couples coming together and even old friends meeting just to catch up,\u201d Buddingh said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTime apart from his long-distance love has taught him to appreciate the little things, he said.\n\nAbove all, though, \u201cthis park shows that love knows no borders.\u201d\n\nRead more:"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus-cases-deaths-reopening-second-wave/2020/06/15/3282d27e-ae4b-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-06-16T11:00:00", "title": "Brazil ignored the warnings.

At the request of Rio officials, his team was assembling a list of recommendations. He needed to make clear what would happen if they didn\u2019t immediately impose a complete lockdown.\n\n\u201cIt would result,\u201d the team warned in the early May report, \u201cin a human catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the officials never instituted a lockdown. Cases and deaths soared. People stopped isolating, choosing instead to pack beach boardwalks on weekends. And the warning turned out to be just one more exit ramp that Brazil declined to take on its way toward becoming the second-most disease-ravaged country in the world.\n\nLatin America\u2019s largest country has so far registered more than 888,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 44,000 deaths, second on both counts only to the United States. But while other countries have been through steep curves and are now focused on preparations for a possible second wave, Brazil can\u2019t even get past its first.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening here appears to be unique on a global level. Despite soaring numbers, officials never implemented measures largely successful elsewhere in the world. There has been no national lockdown. No national testing campaign. No agreed-upon plan. Insufficient health-care expansion. Instead, the hardest-hit cities are now deciding to open up, throwing open the doors to malls and churches, at a time when the country is routinely posting more than 30,000 new cases a day \u2014 five times more than Italy reported at the peak of its outbreak.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe inaction has pushed the country onto a path that scientists call uncharted.\n\n\u201cWe are doing something that no one else has done,\u201d said Pedro Hallal, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of Pelotas. \u201cWe\u2019re getting near the curve\u2019s peak, and it\u2019s like we are almost challenging the virus. \u2018Let\u2019s see how many people you can infect. We want to see how strong you are.\u2019 Like this is a game of poker, and we\u2019re all in.\u201d\n\nBrazil is on a trajectory to register more than 4,000 deaths per day and overtake the United States in both cases and deaths by the end of July, according to researchers at the University of Washington. But just as the pandemic is magnifying the similarities between the United States and Brazil \u2014 two continent-sized countries with extreme inequality and populist presidents \u2014 it is also revealing the chasm between them. Brazil has neither the world\u2019s biggest economy, nor one of its strongest health-care systems, nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLimited resources always meant that Brazil had far less room for error \u2014 less room for political disagreement in the face of an outbreak \u2014 than its more developed peers. But despite the stakes, the country never found unity. President Jair Bolsonaro, who continues to dismiss the disease and its victims, has urged a policy of doing nothing. He has attacked governors who advocated restrictive measures as corrupt liars, waded into crowds of supporters in defiance of his advisers\u2019 admonitions and threatened to host a large barbecue to spite public health recommendations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe never empowered health experts and scientists to lead a response. Instead, they were undermined and ignored, sidelined and pushed out. He fired his first health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, whose sober briefings had calmed anxious Brazilians, after they\u2019d clashed over the need for social distancing. Then he pushed out his replacement, Nelson Teich, who failed to share his zeal for using chloroquine as a coronavirus treatment. (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week revoked its emergency authorization to use the anti-malarial drug to treat the coronavirus, saying it was unlikely to be effective but carries \u201cpotential serious side effects.\u201d)\n\nBolsonaro has now replaced Teich with a military man who isn\u2019t a doctor.\n\nThe unfolding disaster underscores the limits of scientific persuasion in a country where faith in institutions has plunged for years. It\u2019s not just federal officials who have declined to follow the experts\u2019 guidelines. Large portions of the population, either because of poverty or apathy, are now living their lives largely as before \u2014 going to the beach, attending parties and other get-togethers, riding crowded buses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a failure,\u201d said L\u00edgia Bahia, a professor of public health at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough political force to impose another way. The scientists alone, we couldn\u2019t do it. There\u2019s a sense of profound sadness that this wasn\u2019t realized.\u201d\n\nHaving decided to open up despite scientific consensus that it should not, the country is now lurching down a path that so far only Sweden has attempted to navigate \u2014 but in a much less tactical, methodical fashion. In some pockets of the country \u2014 particularly the north \u2014 one-fourth of people have already developed antibodies to the disease. If herd immunity is to happen in any country, it might happen in Brazil first.\n\n\u201cThe question is, \u2018Where will this go?\u2019 \u201d said Theo Vos, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington, whose models are used by the White House. \u201cIt could be that in Brazil, you could start reaching saturation, where so many people in the population have been in contact with the virus that it starts to come down.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe paused.\n\n\u201cBut it comes at an enormous toll. It\u2019s the sort of situation that we\u2019re advising governments to try and avoid.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have another example of where for the moment it is looking bleaker.\u201d\n\nOne city in the throes of this wrenching process is Boa Vista, in the underdeveloped and isolated Amazonian state of Roraima. More than one-fourth of its 277,000 residents have developed antibodies to the disease, according to Brazilian scientists conducting an ongoing study. The public system has stopped testing people. Promised field hospitals never materialized. The situation has grown so grave that patients are being flown to Manaus, itself a global symbol of the damage the virus can inflict on the developing world.\n\nAD\n\nBut most of the country is far from achieving herd immunity, which occurs when between 60 and 70 percent of the population has been infected by or exposed to a disease or vaccine and can now resist it. By early June, less than 3 percent of the population had covid-19 antibodies. In Rio, where 5,000 people have died, the rate was less than 8 percent.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo end in sight,\u201d read a large headline in the O Globo newspaper last week.\n\nWhen Machado, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation scientist, was asked how much could have been averted if his warnings had been heeded, he looked pained.\n\n\u201cFrom the point of view of public health, it\u2019s incomprehensible that more rigorous measures weren\u2019t adopted,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have avoided many of the deaths and cases and everything else that is happening in Rio de Janeiro.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was an opportunity lost.\u201d"}, {"link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/06/16/israel-annexation-is-saying-quiet-part-loud/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world", "published": "2020-06-16T17:00:00", "title": "For Israel, West Bank annexation is saying the quiet part loud", "author": ["Ishaan Tharoor", "Columnist Covering Foreign Affairs", "Geopolitics"], "text": "The problem for Netanyahu and his allies is that much of the world opposes their plans.

But for the Palestinians, for whom a genuine state seems further away than ever, the bargains of the 1990s \u201clook very lopsided,\u201d Lynk added.\n\nNow, some European governments have condemned the prospect of annexation \u2014 with one top diplomat recently branding it \u201ca gross violation of international law\u201d tantamount to \u201cstealing.\u201d Israel\u2019s Arab neighbors are furious.

(Ben Chernesky/Twitter @Zombery360)\n\nA vicious hailstorm pounded Calgary, Canada, on Saturday, turning a summer day into a virtual winter wonderland as chunks of ice the size of tennis balls ricocheted out of the sky. Wind-driven hailstones shattered windows and windshields, peeled the siding off homes and businesses, and coated the ground several inches thick, making it a monochromatic icy landscape.\n\n[Towering corkscrew-shaped storms swirled over Alberta last June]\n\nTrees were stripped bare in some areas where heavy hail shredded vegetation. Elsewhere, reports of funnel clouds accompanied the ominous storm as it churned through the city of 1.4 million.\n\nThe same storms produced serious flooding, inundating streets and leaving numerous vehicles up to their canopies in water. The region had been under a severe thunderstorm watch for much of the afternoon.\n\nCalgary International Airport first reported thunder at 6:40 p.m. Saturday, around the same time Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the city. Hail began falling at the airport at 7:02 p.m., the temperature slipping 5.4 degrees in six minutes as ice piled up and cooled the ground.\n\n\n\nThe GOES West weather satellite reveals the \u201covershooting top\u201d of a potent thunderstorm that hit Calgary on Saturday. (RAMMB/CIRA)\n\nThe hail briefly stopped at the airport at 7:09 p.m. but resumed at 7:16 p.m. During the same window, winds pivoted from southerly to almost due northerly. That\u2019s probably indicative of the \u201crear flank downdraft\u201d passing over the airport. That\u2019s a region of a rotating thunderstorm that features a crash of precipitation and a surge of high-altitude chilly air on a thunderstorm\u2019s backside. Visibilities dropped to a quarter-mile as the hail core passed overhead.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear just how big the hail got, but in parts of the city, it was estimated to be the size of a golf ball or even a tennis ball. It appears some of the largest may have fallen in the CornerBrook neighborhood just northeast of the airport. Social media images revealed the siding of homes destroyed, with hail littering the streets after puncturing holes in windshields.\n\n\n\nHail stripped siding off this home in Calgary on Saturday. (Marita Lund-Roberts)\n\nIn some areas, an abundance of small hail came down, piling up to several inches deep. The scene resembled that of a winter snowstorm, flashes of lightning reflecting off the icy white background like strobe lights in a disco. Piles formed beneath gutters and roofs where chutes of hail became concentrated.\n\nSome residents even reported the ice balls rocketing through windows and into homes.\n\nEqually problematic was severe flooding, especially along the northern side of Calgary. Hail contributed to clogging storm drains, the frozen pebbles caught in the rapids and carried down area roadways like debris in a roaring river.\n\n\n\nHeavy rainfall triggered flash flooding in Calgary on Saturday. (Rohan Johnson/Twitter)\n\nDeerfoot Trail \u2014 Route 2 \u2014 was flooded after nearly two inches of rain fell in one hour. Vehicles became stuck in the floodwaters, submerged beneath a rapidly rising sea of rain and hail. Some routes had already become virtually impassible, drivers hampered by mounds of hail. Others had previously suffered shattered windshields.\n\nFunnel clouds were also seen south of the city, with reports that a tornado may have touched down to the southeast.\n\nA tornado was also spotted in Taber, about 100 miles southeast of Calgary.\n\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported that more than 10,000 customers lost power for a time following Saturday\u2019s storms.\n\nCanada may not feature the prolific tornado outbreaks common to the Great Plains, but a sliver of traditional Tornado Alley extends north into the Canadian Prairie. Southeastern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba do occasionally get significant severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. A secondary hot spot stretches from near Toronto to Quebec.\n\nViolent tornadoes can and occasionally do strike Canada. On June 22, 2007, Canada\u2019s first and only recorded F5 tornado ravaged Elie, Manitoba, causing more than $40 million in damage. Elie is located 30 miles west of Winnipeg.\n\nMore recently, sculpted supercell thunderstorms swirled across Alberta on June 18 last year. While no tornadoes touched down, their picturesque structures rivaled the sights and scenes of Oklahoma and Kansas.\n\nHere is some more footage from the Calgary hailstorm:\n\n#abstorm absolute destruction in cornerbrook in NE Calgary, 53.5mm hail and it\u2019s been melting for half an hour, some stones were even bigger pic.twitter.com/fCiLQ3rt5k \u2014 Ben C (@Zombery360) June 14, 2020\n\nDamage from this evening\u2019s storm in Calgary.

Here are the global hot spots.", "author": ["Miriam Berger", "Reporter Covering Middle East", "Foreign Affairs"], "text": "Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported the highest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic: 136,000 new infections on June 7. (The tally by Johns Hopkins University has slightly different figures.) Days later, the United States surpassed 2 million confirmed cases, cementing its place at the top of the confirmed infections ranking.\n\nAD\n\nOverall, more than 7.3 million people worldwide have tested positive for the coronavirus and more than 413,000 people have been confirmed to have died of covid-19. And those are just the infections and deaths we know about.\n\nAD\n\nEven if the recent surge in confirmed numbers may be due in part to increases in the availability of testing, the virus is nowhere near going away, experts say. As early hot spots begin to recover, the epicenters of the pandemic shift. Amid a widespread relaxation in restrictions, from Israel to Iran to South Korea to China, new clusters have formed.\n\nThree months after much of the world shut down, the United States, Brazil, Russia and India are reporting the highest numbers of new daily cases.\n\nAD\n\nUnited States\n\nWhat began in Washington and New York states has come for Arizona, Florida and Texas. Stay-at-home orders helped slow the initial spread as testing lagged. But states have largely lifted measures, and on Sunday, both Alabama and South Carolina hit single-day records in new confirmed cases. Hospitals in Houston are reporting record numbers of patients.\n\nAD\n\nPublic health experts warn that states moving to reopen too fast could lead to fresh round of infections. Numbers so far indicate that has been the case. Coupled with the masses of people who have marched together in protests against racism and police violence, the coming weeks could see further increases.\n\nAD\n\nBeing outdoors at a distance from others, wearing a mask and washing hands, scientists say, are among the best preventive measures. At the same time, experts are already warning about the winter, when the flu hits hospitals, schools and workplaces, compounding stress on the system.\n\nBrazil\n\nThe virus spread through Asia. Then it surged in Europe. Now Latin America is the center of the global pandemic, according to the WHO. Even countries in South America that were quick to shut down, such as Peru and Chile, are seeing infections rise as they ease their restrictions.\n\nAD\n\nBut Brazil \u2014 where the federal government, led by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, has downplayed the virus \u2014 never went into a complete lockdown. Instead, governors and mayors at their own discretion closed schools and shops as the virus kept expanding its reach and the president kept belittling its severity. What began as a cluster among rich Brazilians with the resources to travel has turned into a crisis hitting neglected poor and indigenous Brazilians hardest.\n\nAD\n\nNow, as the above graph shows, Brazil\u2019s outbreak is still widening. The country has confirmed more than 42,000 covid-19 deaths and more than 867,000 cases.\n\nRussia\n\nIn mid-March, Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted that the coronavirus, then wreaking havoc across Europe, wasn\u2019t a problem for him back at home. Months later, Russia has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and among the fastest-growing outbreaks worldwide.\n\nAD\n\nGiven trajectories elsewhere, that\u2019s not much of a surprise: Russia\u2019s shutdowns, which it is easing, helped to slow but not stop the virus\u2019s spread. But what is \u201cdifficult to understand,\u201d WHO expert Mike Ryan said during a briefing last week, is how Russia has maintained such a low mortality rate \u2014 just over 7,000 confirmed deaths \u2014 in tandem with rising infections. Doctors and nurses have been speaking out, despite the danger of doing so in the repressive state, about dire conditions in hospitals.\n\nAD\n\nIn a rebuke to the official narrative, Russian officials last week issued revisions that raised some death tolls for April and May. The virus, after all, is immune to Putin\u2019s usual tactics for maintaining control.\n\nIndia\n\nIndia imposed one of the world\u2019s strictest shutdowns on its more than 1.3 billion people in March. By May, the country started to lift restrictions.\n\nAD\n\nBut even with strict restrictions in place, India\u2019s case numbers continued to rise. That\u2019s because India hasn\u2019t yet been able to flatten its curve, with the shutdowns succeeding only somewhat in slowing the rate of the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nSome 99 percent of the hospital beds in Mumbai, a city of 12 million people, are filled. Delhi\u2019s chief minister warned last week that the number of cases there could reach 500,000 by July, up from the city\u2019s current 35,000 confirmed infections. Sick people already struggle to find an open hospital bed."}]}, "theonion": {"link": "http://www.theonion.com/", "articles": []}}}

It\'s not down as low as I would like,"" Mr Johnson said.\n\n""My judgement at present is that we must proceed cautiously and I think that is shared by the overwhelming majority of the public.""\n\nSir Patrick Vallance, the UK\'s chief scientific adviser, told reporters at the briefing the 2m advice was ""not a scientific rule"".\n\n""It is a risk based assessment on when risk reduces and the risks are associated with distance, so risk falls after 2m,"" he said.\n\nHe added: ""It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is 2m or nothing - that is not what the advice has been and it is not what the advice is now.""\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: New measure is ""to support those who are particularly lonely as result of lockdown measures""\n\nIt comes amid continued debate over schools reopening in England, after it was confirmed most children will not return to classrooms until September.\n\nSir Keir has called on the prime minister to act now to not risk the new target of September.\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, Sir Keir said ""creativity"" was needed to utilise empty buildings across Britain, including theatres, museums and libraries, so they could be ""repurposed"" as makeshift classrooms to ensure schools can resume fully after the summer holidays.\n\nAt the briefing, Mr Johnson also announced a new national ""catch-up programme"" for school pupils in England, and said a return for all pupils in September depended on progress continuing in controlling the virus.\n\nUnder the changes to lockdown rules announced on Wednesday, single adults can spend the night at another house in a ""support bubble"".\n\nThe PM also confirmed non-essential shops can reopen on 15 June alongside outdoor zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas.'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53002557', 'published': '2020-06-10T23:05:17', 'title': 'JK Rowling responds to trans tweets criticism', 'text': 'Image copyright Reuters\n\nJK Rowling has said she spoke out about transgender issues in part due to her personal experience of domestic abuse and sexual assault.\n\nThe Harry Potter author addressed criticism of her response to an article that described ""people who menstruate"".\n\nIn a lengthy blog, she wrote her interest in trans issues stemmed from being a survivor of abuse and having concerns around single-sex spaces.\n\nActor Daniel Radcliffe was among those critical of Ms Rowling\'s comments.\n\nIn the blog post published on Wednesday, Ms Rowling, 54, detailed what she said were the five reasons why she felt the need to talk about the issue.\n\nThese included her interest in ""both education and safeguarding"" and ""freedom of speech"".\n\nExplaining her final reason, she wrote: ""I\'ve been in the public eye now for over 20 years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor.\n\n""This isn\'t because I\'m ashamed those things happened to me, but because they\'re traumatic to revisit and remember.\n\n""I also feel protective of my daughter from my first marriage. I didn\'t want to claim sole ownership of a story that belongs to her, too.\n\n""However, a short while ago, I asked her how she\'d feel if I were publicly honest about that part of my life and she encouraged me to go ahead.\n\n""I\'m mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who\'ve been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces.""\n\nMr Radcliffe, the star of the Harry Potter film series, and Eddie Redmayne, who leads the cast of the Fantastic Beasts movies, have both criticised Ms Rowling for her comments about transgender issues.\n\nEmma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Potter franchise, said: ""Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren\'t who they say they are.""\n\nImage copyright Warner Bros Image caption Eddie Redmayne has played Newt Scamander in two Fantastic Beasts films so far\n\nThe row began last weekend, after Ms Rowling responded to a headline on an online article discussing ""people who menstruate"" by writing in a tweet: ""I\'m sure there used to be a word for those people.

If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth. — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 6, 2020 Report\n\n""My life has been shaped by being female. I do not believe it\'s hateful to say so,"" she said.\n\n""I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.""\n\nIn December last year, the author voiced her support for a researcher who was sacked after tweeting that transgender people cannot change their biological sex.\n\n\'Misogyny\'\n\nIn the blog post on Wednesday, Rowling said she was motivated to address transgender issues through her Twitter account because of what she sees as an increasingly misogynistic society.\n\n""We\'re living through the most misogynistic period I\'ve experienced,"" she continued.\n\n""Back in the 80s, I imagined that my future daughters, should I have any, would have it far better than I ever did, but between the backlash against feminism and a porn-saturated online culture, I believe things have got significantly worse for girls.\n\n""Never have I seen women denigrated and dehumanised to the extent they are now.""\n\nWhy is this such a fiercely debated topic?\n\nTransgender people say they just want equal rights, but some groups believe that will lessen women\'s rights.\n\nA key differentiation is between the words ""sex"" and ""gender"". Our sex, which is physical - male or female - is distinct from our gender, which is psychological and social.\n\n""Women are oppressed on the basis of their biological sex, not their gender identity. There has to be a place for the female sex as a distinct group,"" Stephanie Davies-Arai, who founded the Transgender Trend website - a place for parents to discuss trans issues, told BBC Radio 1\'s Newsbeat.\n\nThis argument - the distinction between sex and gender - is refuted by some, including trans activist Julia Serano, who argues there are more than two discrete mutually exclusive sexes.\n\nInstead, she argues sex is made up of a number of variable dimorphic traits - like chromosomes and reproductive organs - that sometimes align in a person and sometimes don\'t.\n\nRead more:'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-53004748', 'published': '2020-06-11T07:15:22', 'title': 'Edward Colston statue pulled out of Bristol Harbour', 'text': 'Image copyright Bristol City Council Image caption The statue was taken from the harbour early on Thursday morning\n\nA statue of a slave trader that was thrown into a harbour by anti-racism protestors has been retrieved from the water.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrators tore down the statue of Edward Colston during a protest in Bristol on Sunday.\n\nBristol City Council said it needed to be removed from the water because the city had a ""working harbour"".\n\nThe statue will be taken to a secure location before becoming a museum exhibit, the authority said.\n\nPreviously, Bristol\'s Mayor Marvin Rees said he ""felt no sense of loss"" at the statue\'s removal.\n\nWhen the statue fell, Avon and Somerset Police elected not to intervene, saying officers would have faced a violent confrontation.\n\nThe statue has been a controversial fixture in the city, with repeated calls for it to be removed.\n\nOther organisations, including schools, that use the Colston name are now looking at changing their names following the protest.'}, {'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53002805', 'published': '2020-06-11T05:36:23', 'title': 'Trump rejects calls to drop Confederate base names', 'text': 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going\n\nUS President Donald Trump says he will ""not even consider"" renaming military bases named for Confederate generals.\n\nHe tweeted that the facilities were part of ""a Great American heritage"".\n\nMr Trump\'s remarks follow reports that top military officials were open to changes amid nationwide soul-searching after the death of George Floyd.\n\nFor many, symbols of the Confederacy - the slaveholding southern states that seceded, prompting the 1861-65 American Civil War - evoke a racist past.\n\nConfederate monuments have been a frequent target for protesters following Floyd\'s death.\n\nOn Wednesday night a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, was brought down by protesters in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nMeanwhile, demonstrators in the nearby city of Portsmouth attacked a Confederate monument, tearing down four statues, according to local media reports.\n\nWhat did the president say?\n\nMr Trump tweeted on Wednesday that bases named for Confederate generals ""have become part of a Great American heritage, a history of Winning, Victory and Freedom"".\n\nHe added: ""The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars. Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations.\n\n""Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!""\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a news briefing afterwards that the possibility of renaming those bases was ""an absolute non-starter"" for Mr Trump.\n\nShe said he would not sign any legislation that Congress might ever pass requiring such name changes.\n\nWhat prompted Trump\'s tweets?\n\nOn Monday a Pentagon official said Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy were ""open to a bipartisan discussion on the topic"" of removing Confederate names from the bases.\n\nEarlier this week, the US Marine Corps issued an order for commanders to ""identify and remove the display of the Confederate battle flag or its depiction within workplaces, common-access areas and public areas on their installations"".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Racism in the US: Is there a single step that can bring equality?\n\nIn an op-ed on Tuesday backing the idea, retired four-star US Army general David Petraeus wrote of his time at Fort Bragg: ""The irony of training at bases named for those who took up arms against the United States, and for the right to enslave others, is inescapable to anyone paying attention.""\n\nThe 10 bases named for Confederate generals include well-known installations such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia.\n\nThey are all located across the US South predominantly in states that helped deliver Mr Trump\'s victory in 2016, and he is relying on them to support him again in November\'s election.\n\nA lost cause?\n\nJust an hour or so before the president held a roundtable session with black supporters, he was tweeting about his vehement opposition to removing the names of Confederate generals from US military bases.\n\nSuch jarring hairpin turns are standard procedure for this White House, however - as Donald Trump veers from professions of support for minorities to moves that could rankle many of them.\n\nIt may be surprising that the US would even have bases named after officers who led armies against US soldiers, but such are the contradictions that remain more than 150 years after the Civil War\'s conclusion.\n\nSome still view those generals as heroes to a lost cause. That hasn\'t stopped local and state governments from taking down their statues, however, as a slow reckoning with the legacy of the Confederacy is spread to even the deepest portions of the South.\n\nThe president, however, seems unyielding. He has supported what he calls the ""beautiful"" statues, and he\'s willing to lean into a fight to keep their names on government facilities. Even at a time when the American public is reconsidering race relations in the nation, the president has decided this a fight worth having.\n\nWho else wants rid of the Confederate symbols?\n\nThe death last month of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, after a policeman knelt on his neck in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has reopened America\'s long-festering racial wounds.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nascar - a league in which both drivers and fans are overwhelmingly white - announced that it would ban the flying of Confederate flags at its races and other events.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Nascar driver Bubba Wallace wears a Black Lives Matter shirt at the Atlanta Motor Speedway on 7 June\n\nOn Wednesday, US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for Confederate monuments in the US Capitol building in Washington DC to be removed.\n\n""Monuments to men who advocated cruelty and barbarism to achieve such a plainly racist end are a grotesque affront to these ideals,"" said the California Democrat in a statement.\n\n""Their statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They should be removed.""\n\nEach US state gets to pick two statues to send to the Capitol complex, where the Senate and House are situated.\n\nMany of the Confederate figures have been moved to less central locations in the building in recent years, though some lawmakers have argued these statues should be removed altogether.'}]}"

It was also reportedly briefly lit on fire. The base of the statue was covered in graffiti and protesters held signs reading “This land is Powhatan land” and “Columbus represents genocide.” A makeshift headstone poster was also placed in front of the sunken statute in the water that read “Racism. You will not be missed.”\n\n“This continent is built on the blood and the bones of our ancestors, but it is built off the backs and the sweat and the tears and the blood and the bones of Africans,” Vanessa Bolin, a member of the Richmond Indigenous Society, said at the protest. “We’re not here to hijack your movement. We’re here to stand in solidarity.”\n\n“We cannot fight white supremacy without recognizing and uplifting one of its earliest victims on this continent,” Joseph Rogers, another speaker at the protest, said.\n\nThe local media outlet WTHR reported the statue was controversial at the time it was erected for a different reason:\n\nThe statue had been a fixture at Byrd Park ever since it was erected nearly a century ago.

An exclusive USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll finds Americans overwhelmingly endorse the right of peaceful protest outside the White House – a view held by nearly 9 of 10 people across racial and partisan lines. Nearly 9 of 10 heard about the clashes that cleared demonstrators before President Donald Trump walked across the square to stand in front of historic St. John’s Church, holding aloft a Bible. In their wake, Americans by a huge margin, by 22 percentage points, express more trust in the Black Lives Matter movement to promote justice and racial equality than they do in the president of the United States. Former President Barack Obama is more than twice as likely as Trump to be seen as a president who could best handle this moment of civil unrest. Two-thirds of Americans, 63%, oppose the show of force that swept the protesters from the park just north of the White House, the scene of many demonstrations in the past. Almost half, 44%, say they “strongly” oppose it. “That was a bad call,” says Aaron Jones, 40, a Republican from Katy, Texas.\n\nThere’s a new #BlackLivesMatter sign in front of St. John’s Church near the White House @wusa9 pic.twitter.com/A7vGIdFosC — Kolbie Satterfield (@KolbieReports) June 10, 2020\n\nMarch begins to take over streets open to vehicular traffic: pic.twitter.com/b6GmehO27y — Abdallah Fayyad (@abdallah_fayyad) June 10, 2020\n\nMarch begins to take over streets open to vehicular traffic: pic.twitter.com/b6GmehO27y — Abdallah Fayyad (@abdallah_fayyad) June 10, 2020\n\nWord is the fence at Lafayette Square will be removed soon, so people spent the night moving hundreds of posters to under the scaffolding across the street.

"{'link': 'http://edition.cnn.com/', 'articles': [{'title': ""Luxury brands rebound in China, but they've been changed by coronavirus forever"", 'text': 'Hong Kong (CNN Business) Chinese shoppers are finally starting to snap up high-end handbags, shoes and jewelry again, giving the luxury goods industry hope that a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is on the way.\n\nBut leading brands still face a tough road ahead, and will likely have to rethink the way they do business to withstand a damaging, worldwide hit to sales this year, as well as a shift in shopping habits in many recession-scarred economies\n\nSeveral luxury goods companies reported an uptick in China this spring as people emerged from weeks of lockdowns, spurring what some analysts have called a trend of ""revenge spending"" — the release of pent-up demand once people aren\'t forced to stay home.\n\nthis week pointed to China as a bright spot for its jewelry business, saying that retail sales surged around 30% in April and 90% in May compared to the same months last year.\n\nThis was despite a drop of about 40% in Tiffany\'s global net sales in May. ""Our business performance in mainland China, which was the first market impacted by the virus, is indicative that a robust recovery is underway,"" CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said during the company\'s earnings presentation on Tuesday.\n\nBurberry BURBY Others have echoed similar thoughts.said last month that sales of its clothing, bags and accessories in China were ""already ahead of the prior year, and continuing to show an improving trend.""\n\nAnd Swiss jewelry and watchmaker Richemont has pointed to China as a bright spot in recent weeks, reporting ""strong demand"" in a results announcement last month since its 462 boutiques in the country opened back up.\n\n""The data indicates that China is in recovery mode,"" Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, wrote in a note published late last month. Researchers at his firm have created a ""rebound index"" to track consumer confidence, which indicates that sentiment among Chinese shoppers improved significantly through May.\n\n\'Revenge spending\'\n\nBecause of the recent lift, China could be the one market where luxury retailers see a turnaround this year, according to Claudia D\'Arpizio, a partner at consulting firm Bain.\n\n""It\'s actually been very, very positive,"" Edgardo Osorio, founder of Italian shoe brand Aquazzura, told CNN Business. ""China has always been, but is especially now more than ever, one of the most fast, [responsive] customers.""\n\nChinese customers may be spending more money on goods at home because they aren\'t able to travel as easily. Two-thirds of sales from Chinese shoppers typically happen outside China, according to analysts.\n\nBut much of the world is still dealing with the pandemic, limiting foreign trips and the opportunities people have to spend any excess cash.\n\n""Instead of going on holiday, they might buy a Chanel bag,"" said Fflur Roberts, head of luxury goods research at Euromonitor, who added that an uptick in spending is also happening in other countries, including South Korea. ""We are seeing signs of the market returning to a certain extent.""\n\nShoppers lining up to enter a Louis Vuitton boutique in Seoul in May. ""South Korea is almost mirroring what\'s happening in China,"" said Fflur Roberts, an analyst at Euromonitor.\n\nSome shoppers may also be after ""a psychological effect — of coming back to normal life,"" noted D\'Arpizio.\n\nThe rebound in China is important because shoppers there are vital to the global luxury market. They account for 35% of all sales worldwide, according to Bain. Five years from now, the consultancy\'s estimates suggest that could shoot up to nearly 50%.\n\nBut the industry\'s still hurting\n\nBut success in China is only part of the story. As customers elsewhere stay home and hold back on luxury shopping in favor of essential purchases or cheaper, unbranded goods, sales of personal luxury items — including handbags, shoes and clothing — are still expected to take a huge hit.\n\nBain projects that global sales of those items could decline by as much as 35% this year, with expected revenue of 180 billion to 220 billion euros (around $204 billion to $250 billion). That\'s compared to the estimated 281 billion euros ($319 billion) taken in last year.\n\nLVMH LVMHF Global brands have acknowledged the pressure. Last week, for example,disclosed to investors that its board had met to reexamine its pending $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany in the light of the pandemic.\n\n""Coronavirus is forcing companies to rethink almost every business model,"" Roberts said.\n\nA closed Louis Vuitton store in Wuhan in March. Its parent company, LVMH, told investors in April that sales had surged for most of its brands in China as the market there reopened.\n\nThe recent jump in sales inside China ""is not counterbalancing the loss of sales for luxury brands from Chinese consumers globally,"" said D\'Arpizio. ""Overall spending from Chinese is much below last year.""\n\nThe boost of ""revenge spending"" isn\'t expected to last very long, either. ""We see this as a sort of temporary effect,"" added D\'Arpizio.\n\nWhat the industry really needs are tourists, from China or elsewhere, she noted. ""We expect traveling to be the last driver to really come back to normality. It will need many months, probably more than one year.""\n\nHow we shop has changed\n\nTo cope with the new reality of catering more heavily to the domestic market, companies will have to adjust their strategy and figure out how to reach more local customers.\n\nChina is already giving brands a blueprint. Even before the outbreak, shoppers were spending money closer to home as they avoided hubs such as Hong Kong due to mass protests , and as brands reduced the price gap that had typically made their products cheaper elsewhere.\n\nThat pushed companies to open more stores in mainland China, collaborate with local artists and form partnerships with Chinese players. That trend appears to be accelerating.\n\nTencent TCEHY Burberry, for example, is working withon a new online store in China set to launch later this year.\n\nThe approach could be applied elsewhere. Burberry CEO Marco Gobbetti last month called the plan a ""fundamental testing ground"" that could help its teams figure out how to serve customers better in the future.\n\nAnd as long as travel is restricted, brands may have to tailor offerings in each market, according to analysts.\n\nThat\'s a pivot for businesses, which typically rely on the crisscross of travelers and don\'t always spend significant time carving out strategies for individual countries.\n\n""This is also a big change for the stores in Europe that were really meant more for tourists — a shop in Paris, or a shop in Milan,"" said D\'Arpizio. Now, ""growth will come from the local customers.""\n\nShop assistants welcoming customers to Chanel at Galeries Lafayette, on the first day of the department store\'s reopening in Paris in May.\n\nBoutiques are here to stay\n\nSome storied luxury brands that have typically held out on e-commerce are rethinking their strategies, too.\n\nSwiss watchmaker Patek Philippe, for example, recently started selling timepieces online for the first time because of the crisis, according to Roberts, the Euromonitor researcher. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat suggests a subtle shift, although some brands say the allure of going to a store in person won\'t go away anytime soon.\n\n""For me, my boutiques, I decorate them like my home,"" said Osorio, the Aquazzura boss. ""You do need a physical presence because you want the final client to show up and understand [the brand].""\n\nBrands also view stores as an opportunity to ""gain visibility,"" according to D\'Arpizio. That\'s why companies will still continue to invest in shops at airports, even if no one can visit them right now, she said.\n\nAn Aquazzura store in Sao Paulo, Brazil. ""I\'ve always believed in brick-and-mortar retail,"" said Edgardo Osorio, founder of the Italian shoe brand. ""You need these boutiques, these flagships or these physical showrooms in the major locations around the world.""\n\nEven as challenges mount, conventional retail ""is ingrained in the whole luxury world,"" Roberts noted.\n\nShe predicted that companies could eventually reduce the number of stores they operate, or the size of each shop — but they probably won\'t pull away altogether.\n\nWe expect traveling to be the last driver to really come back to normality. Claudia D\'Arpizio, partner at Bain\n\nAnd while Osorio defended the importance of a brick-and-mortar store, he admitted that the coronavirus has pushed him to think about his strategy in new ways.\n\nThe executive recently set out to simplify his business, deciding that instead of putting out four collections a year, he will do just two. He\'s also directed his team to relaunch its website to become more mobile-friendly.\n\n""After an incredible two months where I was literally just thinking, \'How do I survive this?\' Now it\'s about: \'How do I take my brand to the future?\'"" said Osorio. ""It has actually been probably the most creative four weeks of my life.""', 'link': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/11/business/global-luxury-sales-china-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html', 'published': '2020-06-11T00:00:00'}, {'title': 'Hong Kong has only one real rival for businesses thinking about leaving', 'text': 'Hong Kong (CNN Business) American executives in Hong Kong are nervous about the city\'s future as a center for global business. For the minority already considering a Plan B, though, Singapore might be the only realistic option.\n\nMore than 50 respondents to a recent survey conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong said they were considering moving capital, assets or business operations to ""other locations"" after Beijing approved plans for a national security law for Hong Kong. The law will be drafted over the next two months and its implementation will bypass the city\'s legislature\n\nThe law bans sedition, secession and subversion against Beijing and allows Chinese state security to operate in Hong Kong, but it\'s not yet clear exactly what it would mean for business: Even the city\'s top officials have offered few details on how it would work.\n\nBut its existence has drawn ire from Western countries like the United States, which has threatened to end a special economic and trading relationship with Hong Kong. Beijing\'s encroaching authority in the semi-autonomous city has also sparked fears about whether more restrictive measures could be introduced that would affect Hong Kong\'s tax structure and open regulatory environment for foreign companies.\n\nWhile only 180 AmCham members took the survey — about 15% of the organization\'s membership — the responses suggest that alternatives to Hong Kong are on the table for dozens of companies. AmCham said its respondents listed several relocation options, including Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Bangkok and Taipei.\n\nIt\'s ""only natural to think about alternative locations in case business conditions deteriorate quickly,"" said David Dollar, a senior fellow at the John L. Thornton China Center, part of the Washington-based Brookings Institution.\n\nBut for many American firms that are developing contingency plans, there really isn\'t a lot of competition. And of the options available, only one other financial hub stands out.\n\n""China\'s move undermines the confidence that companies have in Hong Kong as a location for doing business related to China and the rest of East Asia,"" Mauro Guillen, professor of international management at the University of Pennsylvania\'s Wharton School, told CNN Business. ""If they see problems and uncertainty, many will leave. The winners? Singapore, Singapore and Singapore.""\n\nWhy Singapore?\n\nThe Southeast Asian city-state has for years been one of the region\'s top financial centers. While Hong Kong still boasts a much larger stock market and remains Asia\'s preferred city for share issues, the Singaporean government has worked to grow its status as a business hub. Analysts often cite Singapore\'s convertible currency and favorable regulatory environment as positives for foreign companies.\n\nIn 2018, Deloitte ranked Singapore second only to Switzerland as an international wealth management center, in terms of competitiveness and performance. And last fall, Singapore knocked the United States out of the top spot in the World Economic Forum\'s annual competitiveness report, scoring high marks for its infrastructure, health, labor market and financial system.\n\nSingapore has for years been one of Asia\'s top business centers.\n\nThe city state has also developed a reputation as a hub for biotech firms, according to Rob Chipman, CEO of Asian Tigers Group, a Hong Kong-based relocation services firm. Chipman is a former chairman of AmCham in Hong Kong.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline GSK Merck MRK ""If you are in microtechnology or biotech industry and need to have physical presence, you may want to move to Singapore for business purposes,"" he said. Companies likeand Roche Diagnostics, for example, have regional headquarters in the city.\n\nSingapore is also the only meaningful option for many financial services firms, according to Vincent Chan, China strategist for Alētheia Capital, an Asian investment advisory firm based in Hong Kong. Chan was previously the managing director and head of China equity strategy at Credit Suisse.\n\nEnglish, after all, is an official language in Singapore — a quality Chan called key for foreign businesses looking at potential regional headquarters. The language is far less pervasive in cities like Tokyo, Bangkok and Taipei, making them ""less advantageous,"" he said.\n\nGeographical proximity to other major business hubs is also a positive. Travel time is critical for companies that often need to manage different markets in the Asia Pacific region, which stretches from the northernmost borders of China and Mongolia to the southern tip of Australia and neighboring New Zealand.\n\nThat rules out cities like Sydney, said Chan, who noted that flying between the Australian city and places like Tokyo and Beijing can take roughly 10 hours. By comparison, Singapore is only a few hours from many of the region\'s most important players.\n\nThere are some concerns, however. Last year, for example, the Singaporean government introduced a controversial fake news law that critics said was leading to increased censorship and official overreach in a country where freedom of expression is already under pressure.\n\nThe analysts who spoke to CNN Business, though, said that free speech issues — in Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere — aren\'t nearly as concerning to businesses as fears of financial instability or change.\n\nSingapore has taken ""economic freedom"" seriously, said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Adamas Asset Management based in Hong Kong.\n\n""While that economic freedom doesn\'t always translate into social or other non-economic arenas, Western investors are still generally inclined to favor Singaporean paternalism over Chinese authoritarianism,"" he added.\n\nSome may adjust\n\nDespite Singapore\'s reputation as a stable financial hub, experts stressed that Hong Kong is still the top choice for most businesses.\n\n""Yes, people are moving to Singapore from Hong Kong. But that has been going on all the time,"" said Chipman, of the Asian Tigers Group. ""It\'s nothing new at all.""\n\nOther analysts pointed out only some types of companies with a large presence in Hong Kong may need to consider what options they have. And even then, it depends on how the business environment changes.\n\nTech firms, for example, might consider Hong Kong untenable if the city is no longer exempt from US export controls, according to Jeffrey Wright, a Washington-based analyst for Eurasia Group. US President Donald Trump said in May that Washington wants to revoke the special treatment it gives Hong Kong , impacting the ""full range"" of agreements they share — including export controls.\n\nFinancial services firms, meanwhile, may still be waiting to see whether the Trump administration\'s actions impact them. Trump hasn\'t yet detailed any measures that could affect that sector.\n\nFor many global companies, China is also the major reason they\'re in Asia. That makes Hong Kong\'s proximity to the mainland a big plus, and an advantage that Singapore just can\'t match.\n\n""The global firms with multiple offices retain their most senior management in Hong Kong for Asia-Pacific, and in Singapore for southeast Asia,"" wrote David Meyer, senior lecturer in management at Washington University in St. Louis, in a report published online in April.\n\nSome foreign companies might be comfortable operating under Chinese law in the end, according to Silvers — especially if their business is ""significantly China focused, or reliant on government good will.""', 'link': 'http://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/10/investing/singapore-hong-kong-american-companies-intl-hnk/index.html', 'published': '2020-06-10T00:00:00'}]}"

He sat on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) during the early stages of the outbreak.\n\n“Had we introduced lockdown a week earlier we’d have reduced the final death toll by at least half,” he told MPs on the House of Commons science committee. “The measures, given what we knew about the virus then, were warranted. Certainly had we introduced them earlier we’d have seen many fewer deaths.”\n\nOfficial figures on Wednesday show the death toll from the virus already stands at 41,128, suggesting that if Ferguson is right, more than 20,000 lives could have been saved by taking more draconian action earlier.\n\nHis comments echoed those made by fellow Sage member John Edmunds, who said at the weekend, of the government’s actions in mid-March: “I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point but I wish we had. I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.”\n\nJohnson declined to express regret that the government did not act sooner, saying the data is not yet available to make a full assessment.\n\n“Frankly, I think a lot of these questions are premature,” he insisted. “There are lots of things that we still don’t know, and this epidemic has a long way to go.”\n\nAnd he pointed out that Ferguson was a Sage member at the time decisions on lockdown were made. Ferguson subsequently resigned, after breaking lockdown rules to meet with a lover.\n\nEarlier, during tense exchanges in the Commons, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, confronted the prime minister over his claim that he was “proud” of the government’s response.\n\nCiting the official death toll, as well as the Office for National Statistics estimate of 63,000 excess deaths during the pandemic, Starmer said: “Those are among the highest numbers anywhere in the world. Last week the prime minister said he was proud of the government’s record, but there is no pride in those figures, is there?”\n\nJohnson said international comparisons should wait until the outbreak is over: though he later favourably compared the UK’s approach to returning children to school, to that taken in other countries.\n\nPlay Video 4:08 Keir Starmer accuses UK PM of 'flailing around' on school reopenings – video\n\nThe row came on the eve of Johnson’s self-imposed deadline for getting on top of the pandemic. On 19 March he said that it would take 12 weeks to “turn the tide”. But he is now facing mounting disquiet over his handling of the crisis, with backbench MPs increasingly vocal, including over the government’s quarantine plans, and its failure to open schools to more pupils.\n\nThe prime minister promised a “catch-up” programme for pupils over the summer: and conceded that he had not been able to open schools more rapidly because the infection is not yet sufficiently under control.\n\nWhile Johnson nevertheless highlighted the opening of zoos, and the creation of “support bubbles” to tackle loneliness, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, struck a sombre tone at the press conference.\n\n“The epidemic is shrinking, but not fast,” he said. “The numbers are coming down, but they’re not yet very low. And the vast majority of the population remains susceptible to that infection.”\n\nHe said that meant changes must take place slowly and might need to be reversed. However, he did offer a hint that the government’s two-metre advice for social distancing could be relaxed.\n\nVallance told the briefing: “It is not a scientific rule – it is a risk-based assessment on when risk reduces … It is wrong to portray this as a scientific rule that says it is two metres or nothing.”\n\nWhitty also warned that some restrictions may need to be reimposed if there is a resurgence in cases later in the year, for example.\n\n“There is a reasonable chance that in the winter, this virus will have some advantages it doesn’t have in the rest of the year,” he said. “It’s something which transmits more easily indoors, for example. We are not at the end of this epidemic, not by a long shot. We’re in the middle of it.”\n\nAsked about his greatest regret in the management of the outbreak, Whitty highlighted the failure to increase testing capacity more rapidly.\n\n“If I had to choose one, it would be probably be looking at how we could speed up testing, very early on in the epidemic,” he said. “Many of the problems we had came because we were unable to work out exactly where we were, and we were trying to see our way through the fog.”\n\nPlay Video 2:17 Boris Johnson announces 'support bubble' plan for England – video\n\nScientists at Imperial College and a second team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine modelled the impact of lockdown in February. But it was the realisation that the size of the epidemic was doubling every four days and greater clarity over the severity of the illness that prompted Sage to recommend lockdown.\n\nAccording to Ferguson, it was around nine days after that modelling, which was only one stream of information ministers were reviewing, that lockdown was announced.\n\nBefore March, scientists believed the UK had far fewer infections than it actually had. But it later became clear that between 1,500 and 2,00 cases arrived from Italy and Spain in the first two weeks of that month. At the time, the modellers assumed about two-thirds of infected people coming into the UK were not being identified, but Ferguson said a more accurate figure was about 90%.\n\nThe Sage committee recommended that travellers should be tested when arriving from countries that had been identified as having active transmission, but the scale of the risks from Italy and Spain were not appreciated at the time. “We frankly underestimated how far into the epidemic the country was,” Ferguson said.""}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/in-12-weeks-we-can-turn-the-tide-now-we-can-ask-was-pm-right', 'published': '2020-06-11T06:00:41', 'title': ""'In 12 weeks we can turn the tide': now we can ask – was PM right?"", 'text': 'On 19 March, just a few days before he self-isolated with Covid-19, a sunken-eyed Boris Johnson told the daily Downing Street briefing that in 12 weeks “we can turn the tide”. “I am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing,” he said.\n\nOn Thursday those 12 weeks are up – and they have seen the country go through turmoil.\n\nThe prime minister struggled for his life in intensive care, and more than 40,000 people who tested positive have died alongside thousands of others with suspected cases. Care homes have been ravaged and now the economy stands on the brink of the deepest recession since 1706, according to the Bank of England.\n\nThe lockdown is being loosened, but fears of a second wave are rife.\n\nSo has the tide really turned?\n\nOn Wednesday, Downing Street was upbeat. But interviews with experts, and analysis of the government’s own data, paint a grim picture of what the UK has endured – and a lack of confidence about what the next 12 weeks may hold.\n\nFirst glance at the now-familiar government graphs suggest the curves tracking new infections and deaths are showing significant improvements, at least when viewed from the devastating peak of the outbreak around Easter, when new infections hit 3,918 on 5 April and deaths peaked at 943 a day on 11 April, taking rolling averages.\n\nCloser inspection reveals a less comforting picture. When Johnson spoke 12 weeks ago there were 913 new cases of coronavirus recorded each day on average. At the latest count there were 1,543.\n\nTwelve weeks ago the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths was just 21; this week it remains 10 times higher. As the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, reminded Johnson in parliament on Wednesday, the UK’s excess deaths during the pandemic have passed 63,000 – higher than in Italy, Spain and France. As Greece (with a death toll of 183) welcomes holidaymakers, Britons still cannot stay overnight with extended family in most cases.\n\nScientists are also concerned that as lockdown lifts, the test, trace and isolate system for quelling future outbreaks is not robust enough. The care sector, where at least 15,000 have died from Covid-19 so far, warns that the government’s tactics to protect the most vulnerable in a second wave remain largely unchanged.\n\nIt is too soon, they say, to talk about the tide having turned. The signs for the economy are dark too. Unemployment benefit claims have surged by 70% to more than two million and job cuts are expected to spiral this summer as the furlough scheme is wound down.\n\nIt is the sheer numbers of infections and deaths at the peak that have shocked many. Two days before Johnson made his prediction, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said less than 20,000 deaths would be “a good outcome”.\n\nThat milestone was passed more than six weeks ago. According to Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser and now chairman of an independent version of the government’s Sage advisory group, that could have been the total death toll.\n\nKing has calculated that if Johnson had ordered the lockdown on the day he promised to “turn the tide”, rather than four days later, transmission would have been slashed and fatalities halved. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist and former government adviser, also said on Wednesday that the death toll could have been halved if lockdown had come a week earlier.\n\nWe have not “sent coronavirus packing”, King says, because the R factor – the rate of reproduction – is still not low enough. His group is worried we are risking a second wave by lifting lockdown restrictions now.\n\n“There has been a series of really dreadful mistakes by this government that has led to a vast number of people dying and they need not have died,” he said.\n\nHis calculation about an earlier lockdown was supported by Prof Roland Kao, chair of epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh. He found that if Scotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier, its death toll could have been cut to a fifth of the country’s 4,000 deaths now linked to the disease.\n\n“Cutting the virus off earlier has a huge benefit,” said Kao, who warned the tail of the epidemic is likely to be unpredictable and long.\n\n“When the R number is around one, you see extreme variability of outcome,” he said. “If people take [easing of lockdown] too lightly the end result is we head back in the other direction. So in terms of whether we have turned the tide it would seem unwise to think it is job done.”\n\nSome modellers predict more grief to come even in this first wave. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington DC, for example, believes the UK could suffer another 3,500 Covid deaths by 4 August.\n\nCritics say the tide has not turned in other ways too. The government’s test, trace and isolate system remains “not even close” to being able to keep up with new infections, said King. Care homes complain about a continued lack of testing to control outbreaks which can spread through asymptomatic staff and residents.\n\n“We need much clearer protocols on planning for a second wave and they need to make their plans public,” said Martin Green, chief executive of the industry group Care England. “We need either weekly or fortnightly testing.”\n\nCare minister Helen Whately said on Tuesday she is expecting scientific advice soon on the appropriate frequency of repeat testing.\n\nSome care managers now want ministers to use hospitals to quarantine infected residents in future outbreaks, as happened in Hong Kong where no one has died from Covid-19 in a care home.\n\n“In any assessment of turning the tide you have to include preparedness and clarity of action against Covid,” said Dan Hayes, chief executive of the Order of St John Care Trust, which runs 82 care homes and accommodation centres where 242 residents died from Covid-19. “We still don’t have certainty about care residents being able to access hospital treatment on the same basis as everyone else. There is still a viewpoint that people in care homes will not benefit from treatment.”\n\nThe shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the government’s “Protect the NHS” mantra had obscured other important aims.\n\n“The prime minister had all this rhetoric about turning tides, and taking things on the chin,” he said. “Twelve weeks later, we have one of the highest excess death rates in the world. And yes, the NHS has coped: but it’s coped on the back of discharging its patients into care homes; cancelling operations; delaying treatments for cancer – which probably means we’ll have waiting lists at 10m by Christmas.”\n\nDowning Street, by contrast, takes a very different view of its performance – and the outlook for the future.\n\nReferring to Covid-19 as “an invisible mugger”, Johnson claimed in the House of Commons on Wednesday that it had been an “astonishing achievement” to “drive down the curve”.\n\nAsked about whether the country had “turned the tide”, his spokesperson added: “Thanks to the very hard work of the British public we have now passed through the peak and you are seeing the key indicators like the new hospital admissions, new infections and the number of deaths falling. But at the same time we know we have much, much more to do in order to both beat this virus and put the country fully on the road to recovery.”'}, {'link': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/marmite-supplies-hit-by-covid-19-beer-brewing-slowdown-yeast', 'published': '2020-06-11T01:53:57', 'title': 'Yeast of our worries: Marmite supplies hit by Covid-19 beer brewing slowdown', 'text': 'Company says due to brewer’s yeast being in short supply, production of the spread has been affected\n\nMarmite can only produce small jars due to the coronavirus pandemic, a company tweet has suggested.\n\nThe spread, made with yeast extract, is now only being produced in a 250g size jar as a result of brewers’ yeast being more difficult to get hold of, a message sent on the company’s official account said on Wednesday.\n\nWhen asked by a customer why larger 400g squeezy jars were hard to get hold of at the moment, the firm replied: “Due to brewers yeast being in short supply (one of the main ingredients in Marmite) Supplies of Marmite have been affected.\n\n“As a temporary measure we have stopped production of all sizes apart from our 250g size jar which is available in most major retailers.”\n\nMarmite (@marmite) Hi Tim, due to brewers yeast being in short supply (one of the main ingredients in Marmite) Supplies of Marmite have been affected.\n\n\n\nAs a temporary measure we have stopped production of all sizes apart from our 250g size jar which is available in most major retailers.\n\nBrewers slowed and stalled production when pubs were forced to shut in an attempt to slow the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe twitter thread split lovers and haters of Marmite: “You hate to see it.

Now, just six weeks later, the US has broken through the grim milestone of 2m positive tests for Covid-19, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.\n\nThe anguish of life lost, of a severely wounded economy and wrenching political turmoil have taken a harrowing toll upon a fatigued American public. But further, perhaps far greater pain is yet to come, pandemic experts have warned, even as authorities wave people back into reopened shops and offices and the US president’s political rhetoric on an epochal crisis dwindles away to near silence.\n\n“Everyone has just looked at the first 100 yards of this marathon,” said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\nEveryone has just looked at the first 100 yards of this marathon Michael Osterholm\n\nOsterholm said a society usually becomes resilient to a virus once at least 60% of the population has been infected, either naturally or via a vaccine, and develops antibodies. This is still a far-off point for the US, with no firm guarantee a working vaccine will ever be developed.\n\n“At most, perhaps 5% of people have been infected,” he said. “If all that pain, suffering and economic destruction got us to 5%, what will it take to get us to 60%? That’s a sobering thought. All of that suffering and death is just getting started. People haven’t quite got that yet.”\n\nThe true figure of infection in the US is almost certainly “multiples more” than the 2m confirmed cases, said Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, but is obscured to the lack of testing.\n\nProblems in developing and rolling out an effective test dogged the initial US response to the pandemic and although testing has now ramped up, only around 6% of the population has received one.\n\nPeople with Covid-19 most likely experience either no noticeable symptoms or only minor symptoms such as a dry cough and mild fever.\n\n“We are very much seeing only the proverbial tip of the iceberg,” said Redlener. “We are hampered by the lack of sufficient testing, especially as businesses are reopening across all 50 states.”\n\nDeficiencies in the stockpile of testing kits, swabs, ventilators and protective equipment for medical staff marked the opening stanza of the pandemic in the US. It was a muddled and sometimes astonishing response embodied by Donald Trump, who predicted the virus would vanish in the April sunshine, squabbled with state governors and pondered the merits of injecting bleach or taking hydroxychloroquine, an unproven anti-malarial drug.\n\nA nurse cleans personal protective equipment after being part of a team that treated a coronavirus in San Jose, California. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n“From the beginning there has been misrepresentations and fabrications from the White House,” said Redlener. “Whatever the opposite of ‘mission accomplished’ is, that’s what this is. It’s essentially been an American fiasco.”\n\nYet even as the US has surged past 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, around a quarter of the entire global total, the crisis has faded from the political agenda.\n\nTrump, preoccupied with sending in the military to crush roiling anti-racism protests over the death of George Floyd, has stopped daily press conferences on the pandemic. Re-openings have been left down to the states, conducted in a somewhat haphazard way with at least a dozen states still experiencing rising rates of infections.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci, the administration’s top infectious disease expert, has admitted not seeing the president in weeks despite the ongoing public health crisis. “Where is it going to end? We’re still at the beginning of it,” Fauci said this week.\n\nA disconcerting element of the crisis for epidemiologists is that so much about Covid-19 is still unknown. The World Health Organization had to clarify it still doesn’t know how often asymptomatic people pass on the virus, after previously saying it was very rare.\n\nIt’s not known why some people grouped together, such as meatpacking workers, have become infected at high rates while others, such as prisoners, haven’t to the same degree. There’s uncertainty over how the virus will react to the summer heat or how big a second or third wave of infections will be. Even the symptoms of the virus, previously thought to always include a fever and cough, have confounded previous expectations.\n\n“There are a lot of things we just don’t know and we need a great deal of humility. We aren’t driving this tiger, we are riding it,” said Osterholm.\n\nThe decisions made as the virus rumbles on will invariably become as political and moral as they will scientific.\n\nWith more than 40 million people already out of work in the US amid an economic downturn that may rival anything seen in the past century, any escalation of lockdown to stop the spread of the virus will risk unbearable mental and financial pain. On the other extreme, attempting to revert to previous patterns of life without a vaccine would likely overwhelm hospitals with the sick and dying.\n\n“We need to really thread the needle between those two things,” said Osterholm. “I worry we have passed over having that difficult conversation. We’ve already decided that it’s over and done with. It’s not.”'}]}"

Most notably, in April, the Justice Department made a formal, Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty request to speak with Britain’s Prince Andrew as part of its investigation into the sexual abuse of minors by now-deceased multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the two Justice Department officials said.\n\nAndrew has said he is willing to cooperate. But U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office in Manhattan is handling the Epstein investigation, has publicly disputed that, declaring at a March news conference that the prince had instead “shut the door” on helping.\n\nA senior Justice Department official — speaking on the condition of anonymity like others in this story because of the matter’s political and legal sensitivity — said some feared the U.K.’s decision to broadly pause transmitting of evidence in response to Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty requests might be connected to the dispute over the prince. A Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, also known by the acronym MLAT, governs how countries share information and cooperate in law enforcement matters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“This is deeply troubling,” the official said. “It appears on its face that the U.K. may have suspended processing of MLAT requests not for legitimate reasons, but to protect a member of the royal family.”\n\nBritish officials, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, disputed that the pause was connected to the recent dust-up over Andrew, saying it was instead because of the Supreme Court ruling in March and concerns over the death penalty in the United States.\n\nA third senior Justice Department official said that in the period since the ruling, the Justice Department and the British Home Office “have been in discussions regarding the data protection implications of that decision. Any temporary pause in mutual legal assistance must be understood in that context.”\n\nAD\n\nThe public squabbling over Andrew significantly intensified this week. After the Sun newspaper and others reported on the Justice Department’s MLAT request for his cooperation, the law firm representing Andrew, Blackfords LLP, issued a statement taking aim at Berman for his public statements. The firm claimed that the prince had “on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the DOJ.”\n\nAD\n\nBerman shot back that the prince had “yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate,” even though he had “nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally — through the very same counsel who issued today’s release — that he would not come in for such an interview.”\n\n“If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him,” Berman said.\n\nAD\n\nOne of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, claims she was paid by Epstein for sexual encounters with the prince when she was 17 years old. A photo, reportedly taken in 2001, shows the prince with his arm around her bare waist, and visible in the background is Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite who accusers say was Epstein’s girlfriend and madam. Andrew claimed to the BBC last year that he had “no recollection” of meeting Giuffre.\n\nAD\n\nAsked specifically about Andrew’s situation, a Home Office spokesperson said, “As a matter of long-standing policy and practice, we neither confirm nor deny the existence of mutual legal assistance requests.”\n\nSpokespeople for the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nThe case that sparked the March Supreme Court decision in the U.K. is over British cooperation in a U.S. investigation into two Islamic State militants — Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh — who are suspected of killing Western hostages and are being held by the U.S. military in Iraq. The two were part of a four-man Islamic State cell known as “the Beatles,” named for the members’ British accents.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Virginia want to try the men in the United States and have told their bosses they have evidence — with the most compelling material coming from Britain — to support charges such as conspiring to provide material support to terrorists with acts resulting in death, and conspiring to take hostages with acts resulting in death. But Britain’s help with the case has essentially been put on hold by a lawsuit in the U.K. over the matter.\n\nAD\n\nIn the June 4 message to U.S. authorities, the U.K.’s Central Authority wrote that a “full lifting” of the pause in transmitting evidence would not take place until the final order in that case had been “received and fully considered.”\n\nAD\n\nThe U.S. government also is pressing for the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on charges of violating the Espionage Act and conspiring to hack into a government computer, in a case that remains mired in what is likely to be a lengthy court process.\n\nFor their part, British authorities have lashed out at the Americans for refusing to extradite an American woman who was driving on the wrong side of the road and collided with 19-year-old Harry Dunn.\n\nThe woman, Anne Sacoolas, was charged in Britain with “causing death by dangerous driving.” In January, the U.S. government declined to turn her over, arguing that doing so would essentially nullify diplomatic immunity. Sacoolas is married to a U.S. intelligence officer, whose immunity presumably would extend to his family.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said at the time that his government “would have acted differently if this had been a U.K. diplomat serving in the U.S.” and that the American decision was a “denial of justice.”'}, {'link': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/nigeria-borno-state-attack-coronavirus/2020/06/10/0147e06a-ab1b-11ea-a43b-be9f6494a87d_story.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=wp_world', 'published': '2020-06-10T10:21:14', 'title': 'A massacre in Nigeria’s Borno state left more people dead than months of coronavirus', 'text': 'The young adults were out fetching water, he said — pandemic hygiene called for extra buckets — when militants rolled up in trucks, shooting everyone in sight.

It is surging. There were 136,000 new infections reported on Sunday, the highest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic. There are more than 7 million confirmed cases so far. The number of deaths is nearing half a million, with little sign of tapering off, and global health experts are continuing to sound the alarm.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n“By no means is this over,” Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s executive director, said Wednesday. “If we look at the numbers over the last number of weeks, this pandemic is still evolving. It is still growing in many parts of the world.”\n\nLatin America has emerged as a hot spot, currently accounting for almost half of global deaths by the Financial Times’ tally. The problem is particularly acute in Brazil, where the central government has maintained a hands-off attitude to the outbreak even as cases surged to almost 750,000, second only to the United States, but it has also hit countries, such as Peru, that took early steps against the virus.\n\nCases have surged in South Asia. WHO officials urged Pakistan to lock down after officials declared a record number of new cases in the past 24 hours. India is facing a new wave of infection; a top official in Delhi on Wednesday said that cases were expected to soar above 500,000 by the end of next month. Indonesia had its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases for a second consecutive day on Wednesday, with 1,241 new infections.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcross sub-Saharan Africa, there are now more than 200,000 cases: There is widespread speculation that Pierre Nkurunziza, Burundi’s president, who died on Tuesday, was the first world leader to die of covid-19, though Burundian officials have said the cause of death was cardiac arrest.\n\nThe scale of the coronavirus has made it hard to take in. “In the period of four months, it has devastated the world,” Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Tuesday. “And it isn’t over yet.”\n\nWhat's the formal term for 'sticking your head in the sand and hoping a problem goes away' approach? — Devi Sridhar (@devisridhar) June 10, 2020\n\nSome nations that were devastated early in the pandemic look to be losing ground in their recovery. In Iran and the United States, two countries divided by geopolitical enmity, experts are united by fresh fears of a second wave; new cases in Iran have surged to record highs weeks after the country eased its lockdown.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome Iranian officials have blamed increased testing, which in itself raises questions about the first outbreak’s extent. “We don’t know if it will be a second wave, a second peak or a continuing first wave in some countries,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told CNBC.\n\nU.S. states are seeing an increasing number of patients since Memorial Day weekend, when many people socialized in groups in parts of the country, while there are new concerns that the anti-racism protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis could add to a nationwide surge.\n\nIn the United States and elsewhere, the protests about injustice are partly fueled by the racial disparities seen in the outbreak. Protesters have attempted to maintain social distance and use masks and hand sanitizer — but that has not always proved possible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPublic health experts have expressed understanding about the protests. “It doesn’t help to say police violence doesn’t matter,” Gregg Gonsalves, a professor of epidemiology at Yale, told New York Magazine. “The health disparities that have killed tens of thousands of people over a half a century don’t matter. We are saying we understand it matters; they’re public-health issues too.”\n\nBut almost all experts acknowledge that mass protests are a risk — just as the reopening of the economy seen in many nations around the world, including the United States, carries risks. “The facts suggest that the U.S. is not going to beat the coronavirus,” the Atlantic’s Alexis Madrigal and Robinson Meyer write. “Collectively, we slowly seem to be giving up.”\n\nThat demoralized attitude is reflected at the top of American politics: It has been more than a month since the Trump administration held a daily coronavirus task force briefing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat will it look like to finally beat the virus? We can see some glimpses of it, if we look hard enough: New Zealand declared itself coronavirus-free this week; Taiwan is close to that milestone too. Some smaller nations, like the Pacific island of Samoa, have avoided getting a single confirmed case.\n\nTaiwan has only six people remaining in quarantine for coronavirus and hasn't had a local transmission for two months. It recently revoked the ban on eating aboard the High Speed Rail, although your mask must go back on once you've finished that bento. #防疫新生活 pic.twitter.com/ccrNVguBmi — Chris Horton 何貴森 (@heguisen) June 10, 2020\n\nBut until the pandemic is pushed back globally, these victories are fragile. We’ve seen this year how easily the virus can travel to a country and, once inside, spread furiously. Even for countries without the virus, the economic pain is still there.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Wednesday predicted that there would probably be a drop of 6 percent in global economic productivity this year, among the worst declines in a century. If there is a second wave, the drop would be worse — 7.6 percent — the organization said, with unemployment at 10 percent in developed countries in 2020 and little improvement next year.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven in newly reopened New Zealand, that impact is evident. Officials in Auckland said this week that foot traffic and spending in the central business district were only 40 percent of what they had been before the virus. “When you’ve normally got an inner-city workforce in excess of 138,000 people, coupled with international tourists, that’s a major change in customers,” one told the New Zealand Herald.\n\nThere are some reasons to be hopeful. A study by Britain’s Cambridge and Greenwich Universities released Wednesday suggested that widespread mask wearing could help prevent a second wave as damaging as the first. Vaccine trials are beginning and many hope that the ambitious, accelerated development timetables will produce results as soon as the end of the year.\n\nBut there is still much we don’t know and little reason to feel triumphant right now. “This microscopic virus has humbled all of us,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD""}]}"

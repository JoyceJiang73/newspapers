of Columbus are \"very much related,\" Edwards said, in that both embody the \"violent colonization of the United States.\"\n\n\"The first part was Europeans coming and making claims to a place that belonged to indigenous people and then engaging in genocide to wipe them away.\"\n\nThat was followed by the importation of slaves from Africa -- what Alan Kraut, a history professor at American

country's newly elected leader Evariste Ndayishimiye be rapidly sworn in following the sudden death of President Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this week.\n\nNkurunziza's death on Monday, aged 55, came after the May election of his successor Ndayishimiye, who was meant to be inaugurated in August.\n\nThe unusual situation raised questions over how the transition would be managed, as the constitution calls for the speaker of the national assembly to step in if the president dies.\n\nHowever in its judgement the court wrote that an interim period \"is not necessary\".\n\nThe court ruled that the country must \"proceed, as soon as possible, with the swearing-in of the president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye\".\n\nNkurunziza, a devout evangelical who believed he was chosen by God to lead Burundi, leaves behind a deeply isolated country in political and economic turmoil after his divisive 15-year rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 dead while some 400,000 fled the country.\n\nA climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media settled over Burundi, while a personality cult grew around Nkurunziza which saw the ruling party name him a \"visionary\" and \"supreme guide for patriotism.\"\n\nUnited Nations human rights investigators have said the period since 2015 has been marked by likely crimes against humanity committed by state forces, citing extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture and sexual violence.\n\nNkurunziza's decision not to run in the May 20 election shocked many, as it came after the constitution was changed to allow him to do so.\n\nHandpicked successor\n\nHis successor Ndayishimiye, 52, was handpicked by the ruling party's core group of powerful generals, and won the election with 68.7 percent. Opposition claims of widespread fraud were dismissed by the constitutional court.\n\nWhile he is also a general, Ndayishimiye is not a regime hardliner and Nkurunziza was expected to continue to play a significant role, possibly limiting the independence of his successor who is reputed to be more tolerant and open.\n\n\"In principle it is an opportunity for him to free himself, in the sense that we would have expected Nkurunziza to play an important role in the future,\" said Richard Moncrieff, an expert with the International Crisis Group (ICG).\n\nHowever some observers have said he may run into trouble with the generals if he tries to introduce reforms or improve the human rights situation in the country.\n\nAfter the news of Nkurunziza's death Ndayishimiye vowed to \"continue his high-quality work that he has done for our country\".\n\nA source in the French presidency said the country would work with its European partners and \"extend a hand to the new Burundian president\".\n\n\"For the first time we will have a leader who is not just forging ahead regardless of the consequences, wrapped up in divine faith.\"\n\nQuestions over death\n\nThe government has yet to announce a date for Nkurunziza's funeral, but is marking a seven-day period of national mourning, during which it has banned music in bars, nightclubs and karaoke, a statement said Thursday.\n\nBoth Kenya and Uganda on Friday announced they would be flying their flags at half-mast to honour Nkurunziza.\n\nThe Burundian president died of what the government said was a heart attack, however suspicion is high he may have had the new coronavirus.\n\nHis wife Denise Bucumi was hospitalised at the end of May with the virus.

The intention, he said, is to improve competitiveness in the region, support compliance, remove ambiguities in the legislations, and close loopholes that may lead to revenue leakage.\n\nSome tax relief\n\nThe Budget whose theme is, \u201cStimulating the economy to safeguard livelihoods, jobs, businesses and industrial recovery,\u201d offered some short relief to businesses.\n\nTax relief measures such as deferring payment of Corporate Income Tax or Presumptive tax for Corporations and Small, Medium Enterprises (SMEs) until September 2020, followed by the payment of any Corporate Income Tax and Presumptive Tax due April 1 to June 30, for tax complaint businesses with a turnover of less than Shs500 million per annum is commendable.\n\nThis will address the short-term emergency liquidity requirements of businesses, boosting their cash-flow and ensuring business continuity.\n\nMr Kasaija also made it clear in the Budget speech that no interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period. This, he said, is aimed to benefit companies including SMEs, especially in tourism, manufacturing, horticulture and floriculture. The number of taxpayers benefiting from this measure for whom Corporate Incomes Tax is applicable is 10,140 and the Deferred Tax is estimated at Shs12.5 billion.\n\nIn addition, the number of taxpayers benefiting from the presumptive tax measure is 23,892, and the Deferred Tax is estimated at Shs1.38 billion.\n\nThe government also deferred payment of Pay-As-You-Earn Tax (PAYE) by sectors affected by the pandemic until September 2020.\n\nHe said no interest will accumulate on tax due during this period. An estimated Shs65.35 billion due from PAYE for manufacturing and tourism sectors is being deferred. For floriculture sector, the expected PAYE deferral is Shs0.237 billion.\n\nAlso, he noted that government will waive interest on tax arrears and penalties accumulated before July 1 to lessen the tax liability of businesses who voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. The expected tax relief as a result will be Shs50 billion.\n\nIt further emerged that there will be tax deductibility of donations for the coronavirus response. This will be allowed on the value of the donations the private sector has made towards fighting the virus.\n\nDespite the downpour, the Mr Kasaija\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t dampened as he declared that government would expedite payment of outstanding VAT refunds. This will be done by Uganda Revenue Authority who have already been instructed to speed up payment of outstanding VAT refunds due to businesses accompanied by measures to limit fraud. As a result, an additional Shs120.53 billion will be refunded.\n\nBoosting local production\n\nTo promote import substitution and the development of local industries, Mr Kasaija said: \u201cWe have increased Import Duties on goods that are produced or can be produced locally. The Import Duty on agricultural products has been increased to 60 per cent and other products to 35 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cHitherto, we have been importing refined industrial sugar yet we are a surplus producer of sugar. We have agreed with sugar manufacturers to produce refined industrial sugar locally and we shall protect them from imports.\u201d\n\nFinally, regarding specific tax measure, VAT on the supply of agricultural equipment will be exempted. The supply of processed milk will also be VAT exempt to enhance the price competitiveness of milk produced in Uganda.\n\nAnd for the benefit of fighting the pandemic, taxes on supplies for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and management of the epidemics, pandemics and health hazards, will be exempt from custom duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeight of the tax measures\n\nMeanwhile, tax experts and analysts believe the tax measures the government has put across to enhance liquidity (cash) to businesses affected by the coronavirus disease containment measures are not enough.\n\nThey say for key sectors of the economy among them manufacturing, construction, insurance, tourism, hotel and restaurant, trade, transport and generally the services sector that have suffered to near death as a result of the containment measures to suppress Covid-19 pandemic, needed their PAYE waived rather than defer as evident in the tax relief measure.\n\n\u201cThe specific tax proposals the President mentioned are a good start, but will not go far enough,\u201d Country Leader, Ernst & Young Muhammad Ssempijja said.\n\nTo help business, particularly SMEs build their liquidity again, Mr Ssempijja believes it will require not less than six months of proper government support.\n\nMr John Kakungulu Walugembe, the executive director of Federation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises - Uganda (FSME), said the government is simply treating the symptoms and not the disease. To kick-start the ailing economy, delay of payment of corporation and presumptive tax as well as deferring payment of PAYE is not the solution.

Debt refinancing is the replacement of an existing debt by means of another debt with terms and/or conditions that are more favourable. In other words, debt refinancing refers to the replacement of existing debt with new debt.\n\nIn his budget speech yesterday, the Minister of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, Mr Matia Kasaija, said the available resources of the financial year 2020/2021 is more than Shs45 trillion of which domestic resources amount to more than Shs25 trillion, domestic financing amounts to more than Shs3 trillion while external financing, which consists of project support of more than Shs9 trillion and general budget support of more than Shs2 trillion. Domestic re-financing amounts to more than Shs7 trillion and appropriation in Aid is more than Shs215 billion.\n\nMr Kasaija said public debt as of December 2019 was more than $13 billion with external debt accounting for more than $8 billion or 64.4 per cent while domestic amounted to $4.74 billion or 35.6 per cent of total debt stock.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that public debt remains sustainable, we will implement the domestic revenue mobilisation strategy to increase government\u2019s capacity to finance programmes with less reliance on domestic and external borrowing,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Kasaija said in response to the coronavirus crisis, the government has commenced negotiations with some creditors for debt relief. This will free resources to finance interventions in the fight against the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the financial year 2020/21 the total expenditure amounts to Shs37.792 trillion of which recurrent expenditure is Shs19.787 trillion and development expenditure is Shs18.004 trillion.\n\nIn the background to the budget, the Ministry of Finance says externally financed projects in fiscal year 2020/2021 is expected to amount to more than Shs9 billion, and reduce to Shs8.562 trillion in fiscal year 2024/2025, on assumption that some of the big infrastructure projects will be completed and there will be increase in domestic resources available for financing expenditure over the medium term.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, projections for the project financing are highly provisional beyond two years of the Fiscal Framework, because most Development Partners commit funds for utmost two years as reflected by the decline in grants and concessional loans after that time.\n\nExternal Debt Repayments is projected at Shs1.228 trillion.in FY 2020/21 and will broadly increase over the medium term to peak at Shs4.142 trillion in FY 2024/25.\n\n\u201cThe increase in repayment is owed to the fact that repayments of debt acquired to scale up public investments will fall due during this period.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Governor Bank of Uganda, Dr Adam Mugume, told Daily Monitor that the total public debt grew by 13.7 per cent from Shs47.244 trillion as at end June 2019 to Shs53.697 trillion as at end of April 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 40.3 per cent of GDP. Public external debt remains a dominant share of 65.3 per cent of the total public debt,\u201d he said.\n\nSome economists argue that it is better to look at the sustainability of debt-based on revenue ratio to the total debt, while others say it is debt ratio to the GDP.\n\nHowever, Dr Mugume said: \u201cDebt Both measures are good. Debt-Tax ratio is useful to gauge the ability of servicing the debt from tax revenues. This is more relevant is Uganda because tax to GDP ratio is only 13 per cent. Therefore, even if GDP was to rise sharply, a small component of it would be collected as tax.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Mugume added: \u201cDebt servicing in form of interest payments and amortization constitute about 20 per cent of tax revenues. This means every financial only 80 per cent of tax revenues remains for government expenditure before additional borrowing.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Daily Monitor, a lecturer at School of Economic and Management, Dr Fred Muhumuza said the government has always and mainly have looked at the revenue side, which he said is very difficult this time around because there is no way URA is going to raise all Shs21 trillion in revenue for fiscal operations.\n\nGoing forward, Dr Muhumuza said: \u201cWhat they will have to do is to make adjustments on the expenditure side by cutting it down because it is within the powers of the government to do so.\u201d\n\nFor the case of debt refinancing and the budget, Dr Muhumuza said there is option because the government has already contracted the debt and we have to service these debts the government has always looked at the debt ratio to the GDP,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Muhumuza said a debt repayment of external debt on principle is between Shs4-4.5 trillion annually while interest payments are in the range of Shs5-Shs6 trillion.

country's newly elected leader Evariste Ndayishimiye be rapidly sworn in following the sudden death of President Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this week.\n\nNkurunziza's death on Monday, aged 55, came after the May election of his successor Ndayishimiye, who was meant to be inaugurated in August.\n\nThe unusual situation raised questions over how the transition would be managed, as the constitution calls for the speaker of the national assembly to step in if the president dies.\n\nHowever in its judgement the court wrote that an interim period \"is not necessary\".\n\nThe court ruled that the country must \"proceed, as soon as possible, with the swearing-in of the president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye\".\n\nNkurunziza, a devout evangelical who believed he was chosen by God to lead Burundi, leaves behind a deeply isolated country in political and economic turmoil after his divisive 15-year rule.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 dead while some 400,000 fled the country.\n\nA climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media settled over Burundi, while a personality cult grew around Nkurunziza which saw the ruling party name him a \"visionary\" and \"supreme guide for patriotism.\"\n\nUnited Nations human rights investigators have said the period since 2015 has been marked by likely crimes against humanity committed by state forces, citing extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture and sexual violence.\n\nNkurunziza's decision not to run in the May 20 election shocked many, as it came after the constitution was changed to allow him to do so.\n\nHandpicked successor\n\nHis successor Ndayishimiye, 52, was handpicked by the ruling party's core group of powerful generals, and won the election with 68.7 percent. Opposition claims of widespread fraud were dismissed by the constitutional court.\n\nWhile he is also a general, Ndayishimiye is not a regime hardliner and Nkurunziza was expected to continue to play a significant role, possibly limiting the independence of his successor who is reputed to be more tolerant and open.\n\n\"In principle it is an opportunity for him to free himself, in the sense that we would have expected Nkurunziza to play an important role in the future,\" said Richard Moncrieff, an expert with the International Crisis Group (ICG).\n\nHowever some observers have said he may run into trouble with the generals if he tries to introduce reforms or improve the human rights situation in the country.\n\nAfter the news of Nkurunziza's death Ndayishimiye vowed to \"continue his high-quality work that he has done for our country\".\n\nA source in the French presidency said the country would work with its European partners and \"extend a hand to the new Burundian president\".\n\n\"For the first time we will have a leader who is not just forging ahead regardless of the consequences, wrapped up in divine faith.\"\n\nQuestions over death\n\nThe government has yet to announce a date for Nkurunziza's funeral, but is marking a seven-day period of national mourning, during which it has banned music in bars, nightclubs and karaoke, a statement said Thursday.\n\nBoth Kenya and Uganda on Friday announced they would be flying their flags at half-mast to honour Nkurunziza.\n\nThe Burundian president died of what the government said was a heart attack, however suspicion is high he may have had the new coronavirus.\n\nHis wife Denise Bucumi was hospitalised at the end of May with the virus.

The intention, he said, is to improve competitiveness in the region, support compliance, remove ambiguities in the legislations, and close loopholes that may lead to revenue leakage.\n\nSome tax relief\n\nThe Budget whose theme is, \u201cStimulating the economy to safeguard livelihoods, jobs, businesses and industrial recovery,\u201d offered some short relief to businesses.\n\nTax relief measures such as deferring payment of Corporate Income Tax or Presumptive tax for Corporations and Small, Medium Enterprises (SMEs) until September 2020, followed by the payment of any Corporate Income Tax and Presumptive Tax due April 1 to June 30, for tax complaint businesses with a turnover of less than Shs500 million per annum is commendable.\n\nThis will address the short-term emergency liquidity requirements of businesses, boosting their cash-flow and ensuring business continuity.\n\nMr Kasaija also made it clear in the Budget speech that no interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period. This, he said, is aimed to benefit companies including SMEs, especially in tourism, manufacturing, horticulture and floriculture. The number of taxpayers benefiting from this measure for whom Corporate Incomes Tax is applicable is 10,140 and the Deferred Tax is estimated at Shs12.5 billion.\n\nIn addition, the number of taxpayers benefiting from the presumptive tax measure is 23,892, and the Deferred Tax is estimated at Shs1.38 billion.\n\nThe government also deferred payment of Pay-As-You-Earn Tax (PAYE) by sectors affected by the pandemic until September 2020.\n\nHe said no interest will accumulate on tax due during this period. An estimated Shs65.35 billion due from PAYE for manufacturing and tourism sectors is being deferred. For floriculture sector, the expected PAYE deferral is Shs0.237 billion.\n\nAlso, he noted that government will waive interest on tax arrears and penalties accumulated before July 1 to lessen the tax liability of businesses who voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. The expected tax relief as a result will be Shs50 billion.\n\nIt further emerged that there will be tax deductibility of donations for the coronavirus response. This will be allowed on the value of the donations the private sector has made towards fighting the virus.\n\nDespite the downpour, the Mr Kasaija\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t dampened as he declared that government would expedite payment of outstanding VAT refunds. This will be done by Uganda Revenue Authority who have already been instructed to speed up payment of outstanding VAT refunds due to businesses accompanied by measures to limit fraud. As a result, an additional Shs120.53 billion will be refunded.\n\nBoosting local production\n\nTo promote import substitution and the development of local industries, Mr Kasaija said: \u201cWe have increased Import Duties on goods that are produced or can be produced locally. The Import Duty on agricultural products has been increased to 60 per cent and other products to 35 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cHitherto, we have been importing refined industrial sugar yet we are a surplus producer of sugar. We have agreed with sugar manufacturers to produce refined industrial sugar locally and we shall protect them from imports.\u201d\n\nFinally, regarding specific tax measure, VAT on the supply of agricultural equipment will be exempted. The supply of processed milk will also be VAT exempt to enhance the price competitiveness of milk produced in Uganda.\n\nAnd for the benefit of fighting the pandemic, taxes on supplies for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and management of the epidemics, pandemics and health hazards, will be exempt from custom duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeight of the tax measures\n\nMeanwhile, tax experts and analysts believe the tax measures the government has put across to enhance liquidity (cash) to businesses affected by the coronavirus disease containment measures are not enough.\n\nThey say for key sectors of the economy among them manufacturing, construction, insurance, tourism, hotel and restaurant, trade, transport and generally the services sector that have suffered to near death as a result of the containment measures to suppress Covid-19 pandemic, needed their PAYE waived rather than defer as evident in the tax relief measure.\n\n\u201cThe specific tax proposals the President mentioned are a good start, but will not go far enough,\u201d Country Leader, Ernst & Young Muhammad Ssempijja said.\n\nTo help business, particularly SMEs build their liquidity again, Mr Ssempijja believes it will require not less than six months of proper government support.\n\nMr John Kakungulu Walugembe, the executive director of Federation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises - Uganda (FSME), said the government is simply treating the symptoms and not the disease. To kick-start the ailing economy, delay of payment of corporation and presumptive tax as well as deferring payment of PAYE is not the solution.

Domestic re-financing amounts to more than Shs7 trillion and appropriation in Aid is more than Shs215 billion.\n\nMr Kasaija said public debt as of December 2019 was more than $13 billion with external debt accounting for more than $8 billion or 64.4 per cent while domestic amounted to $4.74 billion or 35.6 per cent of total debt stock.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that public debt remains sustainable, we will implement the domestic revenue mobilisation strategy to increase government\u2019s capacity to finance programmes with less reliance on domestic and external borrowing,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Kasaija said in response to the coronavirus crisis, the government has commenced negotiations with some creditors for debt relief. This will free resources to finance interventions in the fight against the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the financial year 2020/21 the total expenditure amounts to Shs37.792 trillion of which recurrent expenditure is Shs19.787 trillion and development expenditure is Shs18.004 trillion.\n\nIn the background to the budget, the Ministry of Finance says externally financed projects in fiscal year 2020/2021 is expected to amount to more than Shs9 billion, and reduce to Shs8.562 trillion in fiscal year 2024/2025, on assumption that some of the big infrastructure projects will be completed and there will be increase in domestic resources available for financing expenditure over the medium term.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, projections for the project financing are highly provisional beyond two years of the Fiscal Framework, because most Development Partners commit funds for utmost two years as reflected by the decline in grants and concessional loans after that time.\n\nExternal Debt Repayments is projected at Shs1.228 trillion.in FY 2020/21 and will broadly increase over the medium term to peak at Shs4.142 trillion in FY 2024/25.\n\n\u201cThe increase in repayment is owed to the fact that repayments of debt acquired to scale up public investments will fall due during this period.\n\nThe Acting Deputy Governor Bank of Uganda, Dr Adam Mugume, told Daily Monitor that the total public debt grew by 13.7 per cent from Shs47.244 trillion as at end June 2019 to Shs53.697 trillion as at end of April 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is equivalent to 40.3 per cent of GDP. Public external debt remains a dominant share of 65.3 per cent of the total public debt,\u201d he said.\n\nSome economists argue that it is better to look at the sustainability of debt-based on revenue ratio to the total debt, while others say it is debt ratio to the GDP.\n\nHowever, Dr Mugume said: \u201cDebt Both measures are good. Debt-Tax ratio is useful to gauge the ability of servicing the debt from tax revenues. This is more relevant is Uganda because tax to GDP ratio is only 13 per cent. Therefore, even if GDP was to rise sharply, a small component of it would be collected as tax.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Mugume added: \u201cDebt servicing in form of interest payments and amortization constitute about 20 per cent of tax revenues. This means every financial only 80 per cent of tax revenues remains for government expenditure before additional borrowing.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Daily Monitor, a lecturer at School of Economic and Management, Dr Fred Muhumuza said the government has always and mainly have looked at the revenue side, which he said is very difficult this time around because there is no way URA is going to raise all Shs21 trillion in revenue for fiscal operations.\n\nGoing forward, Dr Muhumuza said: \u201cWhat they will have to do is to make adjustments on the expenditure side by cutting it down because it is within the powers of the government to do so.\u201d\n\nFor the case of debt refinancing and the budget, Dr Muhumuza said there is option because the government has already contracted the debt and we have to service these debts the government has always looked at the debt ratio to the GDP,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Muhumuza said a debt repayment of external debt on principle is between Shs4-4.5 trillion annually while interest payments are in the range of Shs5-Shs6 trillion. So you can see that Shs10 trillion is used for debt repayments amid low revenue collection,\u201d he said.", "link": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kasaija-announces-new-domestic-refinancing-of-Shs7-486-trillion/688334-5575528-1tg4sh/index.html", "published": "2020-06-12T12:49:46"}, {"title": "Government increases import duty on agricultural products to 60%", "author": ["Martin Luther Oketch"], "text": "By MARTIN LUTHER OKETCH\n\nFinance minister, Matia Kasaija has said the government has introduced some taxes to raise revenue and announced that the import duty on agricultural products have been increased to 60 per cent and other products to 35 per cent.\n\nUganda\u2019s total import bill is $7 billion per year, which leads to outflow of foreign exchange.\n\nPresenting his budget speech for 2020/21 financial year at Parliament on Thursday, Mr Kasaija said: \u201cIn order to promote import substitution and the development of local industries, we have increased import duties on goods that are produced or can be produced locally.\u201d\n\nMr Kasaija said the import duty on agricultural products has been increased to 60 per cent and other products to 35 per cent.\n\n\u201cHitherto, we have been importing refined industrial sugar yet we are a surplus producer of sugar. We have agreed with sugar manufacturers to produce refined industrial sugar locally and we shall protect them from imports,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further said modest adjustments to tax rates that have been made include the excise duty rate on fuel; and adjustments to improve competitiveness in the region, support compliance, remove ambiguities in the legislations as well as close loopholes that may lead to revenue leakage.\n\nMr Kasaija said in view of the recent emergencies the economy has faced, government introduced modest adjustments in some taxes to raise revenue, saying this will support enhanced economic recovery, as well as maintain an acceptable level of social welfare.\n\n\u201cThe modest adjustments to tax rates that have been made include the excise duty rate on fuel; and adjustments to improve competitiveness in the region, support compliance, remove ambiguities in the legislations as well as close loopholes that may lead to revenue leakage,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Kasaija explained that in order to support agriculture, VAT on the supply of agricultural equipment will be exempted, adding that the supply of processed milk will also be exempted from VAT to enhance the price competitiveness of milk produced in Uganda. In order to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic, taxes on supplies for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and management of the epidemics, pandemics and health hazards, will be exempt from customs duties.\n\nMr Kasaija appealed to Ugandans not to look at paying tax as a burden before explaining that tax administration will be strengthened to improve efficiency in revenue collection, pointing out that the capacity of local governments, including the roll-out of the digital collection of fees and rates, will also be enhanced to improve local revenue generation.\n\nHe said in the next financial year's revenue target is Shs21.810 trillion comprised of tax revenue amounting to Shs20.219 trillion and nontax revenue of Shs1.591 trillion.\n\n\u201cThis target translates into a revenue effort of 14.3 per cent of GDP. To achieve this target, we will implement the following new interventions: - Further roll-out use of digital tax stamps and expand the range of products covered in order to deter under-declaration of production 26 and importation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Kasaija said digital stamps will also ensure that goods on the market meet the required health and safety standards; Widen the scope of the income tax withholding agents across all sectors in order to broaden the tax base; Enhance rental income tax collection and compliance by implementing a digital collection solution, as well as gazette rental income tax chargeable in different geographical areas for taxpayers who do not voluntarily declare their rental income.\n\nThe other measures he said are Gazette VAT withholding agents with an applicable VAT rate of 6 per cent, and provide for penalties for failure to withhold; and Rollout the use of Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFDs), which are - cash registers interconnected to the Uganda Revenue Authority, to improve record-keeping and tax compliance.\n\nOn public debt, Mr Kasaija said total public debt as at December 2019 amounted to $13.3 billion, with external debt accounting for $8.59 Billion or 64.4 per cent while domestic debt amounted to $4.74 Billion or 35.6 per cent of total debt stock.\n\nHe said Government\u2019s approach to public debt financing is elaborated in the Medium Term Debt Strategy for the five- year period commencing next financial year. The Strategy seeks to contract only affordable external debt in preference to domestic debt.\n\n\u201cThe approach to reduce domestic debt in preference to external debt is intended to lower the cost of interest payments to 2.2 per cent of GDP compared to 2.6 per cent of GDP, if we were to continue borrowing significantly from domestic sources,\u201d he said.\n\nmoketch@ug.nationmedia.com", "link": "https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-imposes-60--import-duty-agricultural-products/688334-5575040-gns5y9/index.html", "published": "2020-06-11T15:01:31"}, {"title": "How government will finance Shs45 trillion budget", "author": ["Moses Kyeyune"], "text": "By Moses Kyeyune\n\nIn his pre-election year budget, Finance minister Matia Kasaija will internally raise up to Shs32.97 trillion to fund part of the spending pressures in the 2020/21 financial year. The balance of Shs12.52 trillion will come from external sources such as loans and grants.\n\nAccording to figures approved by Parliament in April, the election- year budget has increased by 12.3 per cent compared to the Shs40.5 trillion appropriated for the current financial year.\n\nInternally, the government intends to raise Shs21.7 trillion from domestic revenues while Shs3.5 trillion will come from domestic financing to recapitalise Banks of Uganda.\n\nThe government also intends to raise another Shs7.4 trillion for debt re-financing and an additional Shs215.6 billion will from local revenue for local governments.\n\nExternal budget support\n\nFrom the external sources, Mr Kasaija projects that Shs2.9 trillion will come from budget support and another Shs9.6trillion will come from project support.\n\nBudget support is a method of financing the budget through a transfer of resources from an external financing agency to the partner government\u2019s national treasury.\n\nBudget support, according to Ministry of Finance spokesperson Jim Mugunga, is a package of financing, conditionality, policy dialogue and technical assistance. It may be provided either as general budget support (GBS) or as sector budget support (SBS). GBS supports the implementation of a National Development Plan III, while SBS supports the implementation of a sector-development programme.\n\nThe government intends to fund the budget by 72.5 per cent while 27.5 per cent will come from the external pool. The government used to rely on donor money to finance the budget but the situation has since improved.\n\nTraditionally, Mr Mugunga explained that donors have provided aid either through the financing of specific projects (project aid), which often involved direct participation in their design and implementation, or through providing support to the recipient government\u2019s budget (conditional budget support) while imposing conditionality on how to allocate the available resources.\n\nWith economy and businesses struggling to remain afloat due to Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Kasaija and the Uganda Revenue Authority face an uphill task ahead.

He was aged 68.\n\nSpeaking to a limited number of mourners who were allowed to attend the burial at his home in Nkene village in Manyi Sub County, Mityana District, CDF Gen Muhoozi praised the deceased as a bold man especially in the things he believed in.\n\nMuhoozi said while at times Gen Ggwanga seemed to act irrationally and often gave hard time to the military establishment, it was always for a good cause.\n\n\u201cHe came off as bearknuckled and unconventional in his approach to life,\u201d Muhoozi said.\n\n\u201cBut mostly, it was in pursuit of good causes such as conserving the environment, mobilizing the citizens for agriculture or fighting land grabbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor him bureaucracies and processes were supposed to serve the ends of social justice, not the other way round,\u201d he added.\n\nMuhoozi went on to recount the incident in Lubowa when the deceased famously touched a tractor of a suspected land grabber.\n\n\u201cWe asked him to go to police to record a statement but he said he didn\u2019t want to go to the police to be embarrassed by those young boys,\u201d Muhoozi narrated.\n\n\u201cSo, I sent some people here led by Gen Sabiiti (Muzeeyi) who was commanding Military Police at the time, to take him to record a statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they got here, he told them \u2018I\u2019m not going.\u2019 They said, OK let\u2019s go to Military Police and he agreed.

This time he looked resigned. Weeks earlier, he called me urgently here and cooked for me and when I was about to leave in the evening, he said goodbye which he had never said to me,\u201d Ssemafumu recounted.\n\n\u201cThen two weeks before being hospitalized, he sat under a tree and told Yasin to bring him his dog and a drink.

Relating to what is going on in Uganda, I realized that these farms can work for us, mainly the population that lives in urban areas like Kampala,\u201d he noted.\n\nHydroponic farming is a new innovation where farmers grow crops without necessarily using land. It enables people to grow food without soil and natural light, using blocks of porous material where plants grow with the help of artificial lighting such as a low energy source usually a Light-Emitting Diode(LED).\n\nAfter falling in love with the idea, Makihako\u2019s friend paid for him a six months online course where he acquired skills about hydroponic farms which he says have given smiles to over 78000 families since its inception in 2018.\n\n\u201cAt first our major aim was to prevent hunger but now farmers have gone an extra mile to sell the produce to support their families financially, which is very good,\u201d he said.\n\nUnlike previously when hydroponic farming was expensive, the Ntinda based HFU, simplified it to Ugandans by supplying the hydroponic equipment to all classes of farmers irrespective of whether one is a tenant or landlord and after giving them training on how to operate them.\n\nMakihako says that the equipment cost ranges between Shs 450,000 and Shs 1.5m depending on the type one wants.\n\n\u201cWe have, since inception, supplied 80,000 hydroponic equipment and expanded in four major districts of Mukono, Kampala, Wakiso, and Mbarara,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe enable women farmers to achieve predictable and highly nutritious yields for vegetables and produce their own animal feed at a limited cost of input. With hydroponics, the farmer is unaffected by seasons and adverse weather conditions, which historically has given rise to severe food insecurity in Uganda and Africa at large,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that they have plans of expanding in other Cities when their funding increases, \u201cOur main target are towns where we think a big population is suffering with food shortage,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to Makihako, the current systems favor the growth of vegetables mainly which include: cabbage, Red paper, Yellow paper, Green paper, and practicing fish farming.\n\n\u201cSome of our clients are selling their harvests in Namugongo streets,\u201d he noted\n\nMajor categories of hydroponic systems\n\nAccording to Makihako, there are three major categories of hydroponic systems; Aeroponic, Aquaponic, and Vegetable systems.\n\nAeroponic system\n\nAeroponic systems nourish plants with nothing more than nutrient-laden mist. The concept builds off that of hydroponic systems, in which the roots are held in a soilless growing medium, such as coco coir, over which nutrient-laden water is periodically pumped.\n\nIn aeroponics systems, seeds are \u201cplanted\u201d in pieces of foam stuffed into tiny pots, which are exposed to light on one end and nutrient mist on the other. The foam also holds the stem and root mass in place as the plants grow.\n\nAquaponic system\n\nAquaponics is putting fish to work. \u201cIt just so happens that the excretion work the fish do is the perfect fertilizer for growing plants. Fish can grow a lot of plants when they get to work,\u201d Makihako chipped in.\n\n\u201cOne of the coolest things about Aquaponics is that it mimics a natural ecosystem.\n\nAquaponics represent the relationship between water, aquatic life, bacteria, nutrient dynamics, and plants that grow together in waterways all over the world,\u201d he further explained.\n\nTaking cues from nature, aquaponics harness the power of bio-integrating these individual components: Exchanging the waste by-product from the fish as a food for the bacteria, to be converted into a perfect fertilizer for the plants, to return the water in a clean and safe form to the fish. Just like mother nature does in every aquatic ecosystem.\n\nVegetable system\n\n\u201cWe sell complete hydroponic vegetable systems to suit the needs of every individual or community. Vegetables grown hydroponically are generally healthier than their soil-grown counterparts. They receive a balanced diet and are free of soil-borne pests and diseases,\u201d he further explained.\n\nOur super-efficient hydroponic vegetable units, conserve water, and nutrients by preventing evaporation and runoff.\n\nThe area required to place a hydroponic vegetable garden is very small and therefore the space requirement is not an important factor in hydroponic gardening. A garden can be set up in spaces as small as one square meter (1m\u00b2).\n\nMost family hydroponic gardens are any size between 10 to 20 square meters (m\u00b2), but one can establish a bigger garden for commercial operations.\n\n\u201cAeroponics have microcontroller systems and one can monitor it anywhere using their phone but it is a bit expensive (Shs 3m) so we don\u2019t have it yet here but we have a prototype which we use to explain to farmers,\u201d he emphasized.", "link": "https://chimpreports.com/hydroponic-farming-a-hidden-solution-for-the-vulnerable-urban-poor/", "published": "2020-06-09T22:07:47+03:00"}, {"title": "Untold Tales: Why Obote Returned from Exile Aboard a Zambian Military Chopper", "author": ["Https", "Chimpreports.Com Author Dedan-Kimathi"], "text": "On May 27, 1980, a Zambian Military Chopper carrying deposed Ugandan leader Apollo Milton Obote landed to a heroic welcome at Nyakisharara airfield in Mbarara district.\n\nThis was the first time Obote was returning to his homeland after he had been overthrown by his military commander Gen. Idi Amin Dada way back in 1971.\n\nWhile much has been written about Obote- who came to be christened \u201cNyamurunga\u201d or a pure white bird in Runyankole-Rukiga dialect, it remains unknown as to why he had to fly back in using a foreign whirlybird.\n\nThis mystery, however, was slightly explained by his son and Uganda People\u2019s Congress (UPC) President, Jimmy Akena, at the Inter-Party Political Dialogue (IPOD) handover ceremony that was held at Kabira Country Club on Wednesday.\n\nSporting a floral short-sleeved shirt and grayish pants, Akena intimated that this sudden twist was prompted by a military cable from a reliable source in Uganda that some disgruntled elements were planning to blow them up.\n\n\u201cThere were some people in Uganda who did not want the return and were threatening to shoot down the plane,\u201d Akena vividly stated.\n\nHe says his father Dr. Obote got wind of this first-hand information after the plane that had ferried them all the way from Dar es Salaam International Airport made a brief stopover at the seaside town of Mwanza.\n\n\u201cWhile in Mwanza, my late father was taken to inspect some of the military installations which were still in place- coming out of the liberation war,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nFollowing this sudden security hiccup, a meeting was hastily convened to find out whether Obote\u2019s returning family and friends still had the interest to return to their homeland. However, like birds of the same feather, they unilaterally agreed to make the journey no matter what.\n\nAt that juncture, two military planes were availed; a Tanzanian Military Chopper and another one belonging to the Zambian Government.\n\nAt the time, Tanzania was led by his close friends, Mwalimu Kambarage Nyerere of Tanzania and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia.\n\nA meeting was called and the family members were asked whether they wanted to continue with their journey, they were told that if they so wish, they could remain in Mwanza. Their decision, overwhelmingly, was \u201cwe are returning to Uganda.\u201d\n\nConsequently, it was agreed that families with more members were to be equally distributed among the two planes to avoid the possibility of all of them getting wiped out completely.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I was separated from my father who was on the Zambian Air Force plane. My mother and I boarded the Tanzanian Air Force,\u201d Akena, who was twelve at the time, recalls.\n\nAfter landing in Uganda, they had refreshments before setting off for their western stronghold of Bushenyi where, yet again, the UPC Political candle was rekindled.\n\n\u201cThat day, the 27th of May, 1980, marked the launch of UPC campaign for elections scheduled for December of that very year,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile the party jostled to wrestle back their political crown in December 1980, they were confronted with the fact that there were no laws to guide this process. Immediately after capturing power, Idi Amin had trashed the 1967 Republican Constitution under Legal Notice Number One.\n\nAkena says the party immediately hit the ground running and returned the 1967 Constitution in the thick of time.\n\n\u201cWe held elections under the 1967 constitution which was a multi-party election. There was no amendment which was required for the constitution and no inducements to amend the constitution to allow for that sort of election,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, as the saying goes \u201cHistory repeats itself\u201d, Akena says decades later, Uganda is still grappling with how to hold free and fair elections.\n\n\u201cForty years down the road, with roughly the same time period for the general election, we seem to be still circulating around the issue of how can we have a credible and acceptable multi-party election?\u201d he paused.\n\nAll hope not lost though, Akena is optimistic that such challenges of electoral democracy can be collectively eradicated using the IPOD umbrella.\n\n\u201cWe have made some strides, we have made some stumbles but this offers us a better opportunity to lay a foundation whereby we can go into elections and emerge from those elections satisfied,\u201d he concludes.\n\nEvents before Obote\u2019s return;\n\nIn his book \u201cThe New Military Dictators\u201d Prof Dani Wadada Nabudere (RIP) recalls that a day to Obote\u2019s arrival, there was a \u2018search and impound\u2019 operation for arms around Kampala.\n\n\u201cThis was done on the authority of Oyite Ojok, without the knowledge either of the Army Commander of UNLA, Maj Gen Tito Okello, or of the President (Binaisa) who was also minister of Defence,\u201d Nabudere candidly states.", "link": "https://chimpreports.com/untold-tales-why-obote-returned-from-exile-aboard-a-zambian-military-chopper/", "published": "2020-05-28T22:16:30+03:00"}, {"title": "Traversing the Rough Corridors of Early Single Motherhood", "author": ["Https", "Chimpreports.Com Author Esther-Makula"], "text": "After completing Primary seven, Nansubuga\u2019s education path came to a closure.

These children are often four years behind in their education.\n\nOne 15-year-old boy from Iganga told us: \u201cMy parents died when I was still young and so I wasn\u2019t able to study.\u201d\n\nThe report also found that 15,500 children were exposed to hazardous work on the streets, such as scavenging, carrying loads and selling goods. This is on a daily basis for children living on the streets as well as for 50 per cent of children working on the streets.\n\nHope for Justice has since made urgent calls for stakeholders to focus on prevention, early intervention, short-term transitional care and to \u201cadequately resource\u201d the education sector so that children are given equal access to schooling.\n\nThe organisation\u2019s report, \u2018Enumeration of Children on the Streets in Uganda across Four Locations: Iganga, Jinja, Mbale and Kampala\u2019, and recommendations have been endorsed by the Ugandan government.\n\nThis major study brings together the children\u2019s perspectives on their experiences, reasons why children end up on the streets, insights into their characteristics, and data.\n\nRape and sexual abuse were significant challenges reported by the girls who were interviewed as part of the study.\n\nA 17-year-old girl said: \u201cYouth gangs move around the streets at night. There were 10 of them and they said to me, \u2018You are a beautiful young lady, what are you doing outside at this time? If you refuse to have sex with us, we are going to stab you and leave you dead. If you dare fight back, we will kill you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn addition to emotional trauma, sexual abuse exposed the girls to sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS. Girls also became pregnant and some ended up delivering their babies on the streets. The study revealed that these children lack an appropriate way to report their cases and to seek medical attention.\n\nAlmost every child the charity spoke to shared their dreams and ambitions in life, including returning to school or pursuing a career to become a good citizen; they hoped that they would be able to realise them at one point in their lifetime.\n\nChildren spoke of poverty, family instability and violence as playing a major role in pushing them to look for a better life elsewhere.\n\nThe study revealed that most children had had a poor, unhappy and unstable family experience, including physical, emotional and sexual abuse.\n\nA 10-year-old boy from Jinja said: \u201cThey used to beat me because I was falling behind at school or because I wasn\u2019t quick enough fetching water from the well. They used to beat me using sticks. Dad used to beat me the most.\u201d\n\nThe enumeration and the qualitative study revealed that many families are not getting the support they need to fully care for their children, and that difficulties in accessing education, largely due to costs, is another key factor in children\u2019s presence on the streets.\n\nFlorence Soyekwo, Uganda Country Director at Hope for Justice, said: \u201cThe Enumeration Report is an important piece of work that sheds light on the scale, experiences, and demographic makeup of children living and working on the streets. We have learned several things from the study that have informed our response \u2013 namely, the reasons why children enter life on the streets, what their experiences are, and the kinds of risks to exploitation they encounter.\n\n\u201cThe publication and endorsement of this report by the Ugandan government is a milestone achievement because it allows for a coordinated effort to combat child exploitation.\n\n\u201cThis is the first study of its kind to be conducted in Uganda using this methodology. By using evidence such as this to inform policy and practice, we remain agile, responsive, and proactive in our approach to combatting the exploitation of some of the most vulnerable groups in Uganda.\u201d\n\nJames Ebitu, Ugandan Permanent Secretary for The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD), endorsing the study, wrote: \u201cThis study is important in informing the development of comprehensive, long-term national strategies on street connected children; addressing both prevention and response.\n\n\u201cThis study report gives many insights into the problem of street connected children in Uganda. I therefore highly recommend it to all stakeholders to inform inter-sectoral interventions on street connected children in Uganda to enable all the affected children grow and develop in safe families.\u201d\n\nRecommendations\n\nHope for Justice called stakeholders, state and non-state actors, to place a new focus on prevention, early interventions, and the provision of short-term transitional care for children living on the streets, including raising awareness of child labour, child trafficking and young people\u2019s right to work in conditions that are not exploitative.\n\nThe charity urged the government to \u201cadequately resource\u201d the education sector to enable all children to attend primary school, regardless of their ability to pay for fees and other educational resources.\n\nThe charity further recommended that law enforcement and local authorities are trained and equipped to prevent and identify trafficking, to ensure that child victims are given access to appropriate care and protection, and that perpetrators are prosecuted.\n\nThe compilation of the study involved collaboration with the Uganda Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD) on the planning, process and delivery, and with technical support from the Ugandan Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), including the training of enumerators, data quality checks and a review of the dataset, as well as the support of police, district offices and NGOs.\n\nThe study was funded by a private foundation and The Red Nose Day Fund.", "link": "https://chimpreports.com/rape-and-violence-street-childrens-horror-on-ugandan-streets/", "published": "2020-05-27T09:14:30+03:00"}, {"title": "Torrid Teen Romance: The Irreversible Consequences of Elopement", "author": ["Https", "Chimpreports.Com Author Esther-Makula"], "text": "Driven by the indescribable forces of adolescent energy to satiate the longing of a 14-year-old girl in love, shooting through at utmost speed without slowing down to get her bearings right, Eva, sooner than later, realized that her dream marriage was just a blur image in her head.\n\nJust like the proverbial \u201clonging for a heart that longs not for you\u201d, Eva, now a \u2018Nalongo\u2019 and mother of seven, sacrificed her everything to be with the man who swept her off her feet from the very start.

The windows were opened to allow in plenty of fresh air considering the president is not a big fan of air conditioning.\n\nOn arrival at State House, Museveni received information from Protocol that the businessmen had left the country.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the visibly disturbed President asked.\n\n\u201cTheir lives were threatened by people here. That\u2019s why they fled Kampala,\u201d an officer told Museveni.\n\nMuseveni was shocked and immediately ordered an in-depth investigation into the incident.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nEarlier, China Railway N0. 17 had participated in a bidding process for the construction of the lucrative $1bn Kampala-Jinja Expressway.\n\nThe Kampala -Jinja Expressway Project is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) consisting of a 95km limited access tolled expressway between Kampala city and Jinja city.\n\nThis road section is located along the strategic Northern trade corridor which originates from Kenya\u2019s maritime port of Mombasa passing through Uganda to Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan.\n\nAccording to the Ugandan government, the road project is expected to boost trade with regional and global markets, as well as regional integration of the East African Community (EAC).\n\nHowever, China Railway N0. 17 was eliminated from the bidding process at the pre-qualification stage.\n\nChina Railway N0. 17 blamed its failed bid process to alleged underhand machinations of fellow Chinese rival in Uganda, China Communications construction company Ltd (CCCC).\n\nUsing powerful lobbyists in Kampala and Beijing, China Railway N0. 17 decided to fight back.\n\nThe company wrote to President Museveni, saying it could build Kampala-Jinja Expressway using its own money and recoup the investment through road tolls.\n\nMuseveni was excited thus encouraging the meeting at State House.\n\nLetters\n\nAccording to confidential presidential correspondences which ChimpReports has seen, Museveni revealed that the Finance Ministry told him Uganda could not borrow for the construction of the railway line and other construction projects at the same time.\n\n\u201cMy answer was: \u2018remove Ayago from the list.\u2019 Let Ayago, when possible, be done by the private sector provided the cost of that electricity is US Cents 5. In spite of this clear guidance, to the extent of removing Ayago from the borrowing list with its 840 megawatts (four times the size of Jinja), some officials in the Ministry of Finance, continued to go behind our back and borrow for Kampala-Mpigi expressway etc,\u2019\u201d recalled Museveni in a letter to former Works Minister Monica Azuba in 2019.\n\nAzuba was seeking guidance on plans to borrow money for the construction of Jinja Expressway.\n\nMuseveni added: \u201cWhen I heard, therefore, of the Jinja-Kampala Expressway, my question was: \u2018How about the railway?\u2019 This was because, earlier, I had been told that we could not borrow for the railway because the debt: GDP ratio would breach the 50% level that we have set as a no-go area. We cannot borrow for the railway, but we have already borrowed for the Mpigi Expressway and we are about to borrow for Kampala-Jinja expressway, I was told. How did this come about? Was I not supposed to clear these loans as Head of Government? When did I clear the loan for Mpigi expressway?\u2019\u201d\n\nRegarding Kampala-Jinja Expressway, Museveni asked Azuba: \u201c\u2026the Kampala-Jinja expressway is about to go ahead because negotiations with companies and funding agencies etc are already \u201cadvanced\u201d. The question, then, is: \u201cWhy are you consulting me now?\u201d\n\nChina Railway comes into the picture\n\nMuseveni said in his letter to Azuba that while he was \u201cstill in a dilemma, a Chinese company known as China Railway N0. 17, came forward saying that we did not have to borrow, that they can do the Kampala-Jinja Expressway privately and they will recover their money through road tolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a God-send,\u201d said Museveni, adding, \u201cIt meant that that road, which, of course, I want to be done can be done, but without borrowing, so that space is left to borrow for the railway which is part of the real medicine for the economy.\u201d\n\nThe President said \u201cimmediately, I started hearing murmurings that that will not be allowed to happen. Why? It seems some elements had already been paid to move with the other formula (of borrowing \u2013ED). The other group (China Railway N0. 17) wrote to me confirming that they can do the job; a delegation of theirs came from China, they were given an appointment to come and meet me, but, last minute, they were intimated and had to leave the country. I waited in vain. I have evidence of all this. I also have preliminary information about the whole corruption. I have also involved the IGG in this treachery.\u201d\n\nThe development underscores increased widespread corruption in Uganda\u2019s infrastructure projects.\n\nThe kickbacks involved in the financing and procurement processes of multi-million dollar road construction deals partly explain why the cost of these projects paid by the Ugandan taxpayer remain high.\n\nContractors usually compromise quality of the materials used in these projects to compensate for fatty bribes offered to senior government officials hence shoddy works.\n\nAlternatively, the contractors increase the cost of the infrastructure projects to include the bribes handed to these decision makers.\n\nConfessing that large sums of money are being borrowed without his knowledge and clearance underscores the grim state of affairs in the country.\n\nExperts who spoke to us on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of this story, said China Railway N0. 17 was possibly lying to the president to circumvent the procurement process.\n\n\u201cThe entire cost of the Kampala-Jinja Expressway is about $1bn. Feasibility studies by Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) show that motorists will pay Shs 100 per kilometre on these Expressways. Unless you want to charge higher road tolls, which the government doesn\u2019t want, you would hardly recoup that ($1bn) investment even in 20 years. Secondly, there are two new roads (Mukono\u2013Kayunga\u2013Njeru and Kira-Kalagi-Kayunga-Njeru-Jinja roads). Why would one leave new tarmac roads to pay road tolls?\u201d\n\nMuseveni Blocks CCCC\n\nChimpReports has now learned that Museveni decided that CCCC which is suspected of conniving with Ugandan wrong elements to intimidate China Railway N0. 17 should not be given the contract to construct Kampala -Jinja Expressway.\n\n\u201cI therefore, decided that we cannot accept this corruption. If the suspected corrupt elements scare away China Railway N0. 17, then my decision is that I will not accept the companies which were being fronted by the groups the IGG is now investigating. The European Union and ADB Funding that is ready for the project should be used by other companies that are not part of this cloud of corruption,\u201d Museveni told Azuba then.\n\nMuseveni advised Azuba to consider a French company for the project.\n\n\u201cThe French Ambassador, the other day, brought to me some groups that they say can do the work,\u201d Museveni told Azuba.\n\nAn investigation shows the President was referring to Vinci Concessions (construction and maintenance for infrastructure and public network projects), one of the largest construction firms in the world.\n\nVinci has since formed a consortium with Sogea Satom, which is involved in creation of civil engineering structures, installation of electro-mechanical equipment, distribution networks and treated water storage reservoirs in Uganda, to bid for Kampala Jinja expressway.\n\nApart from CCCC/ China First Highway Engineering Company Ltd; KJ Connect (with Vinci Concessions as the lead member); other consortia competing for the Kampala-Jinja Expressway deal include Strabag/ICITAS, AIIM/STOA and CCKS Consortium and CCKS Consortium (China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd, China Wu Yi Co. Ltd, Korea Expressway Corporation and SK Engineering and Construction).\n\nEmphasis\n\nIn his follow up letter to Finance Minister Matia Kasaija on May 26, 2020, Museveni reiterated that Chinese companies involved in acts of corruption should not be allowed any closer to the multi-billion dollar Kampala-Jinja Expressway project.\n\n\u201cI have received your letter of the 7th of May, 2020, on the proposal to borrow $229.47m from Africa Development Bank (ADB) and the $105m from the French Agency for Jinja-Kampala Expressway,\u201d said Museveni in another confidential letter seen by ChimpReports.\n\n\u201cI support the loan provided two conditions are observed. Condition number one, the debt: GDP Ratio of Uganda must not exceed 50% if we add it to other \u2013 priorities, especially the Standard Gauge Railway and the rehabilitation of the metre gauge railway. Secondly, the Chinese companies that I identified myself trying to corrupt our system and manipulate our government must not be part of that effort,\u201d Museveni emphasised.\n\nDebt\n\nThese loans will increase the country\u2019s total nominal public debt that stood at Ushs. 47.305 trillion (USD $12.55 billion) at the end of June 2019 from Ushs.42.07047 trillion at end of June 2018.\n\nThe existing debt stock constitutes of Ushs 31.098 trillion (USD $8.35 billion) as external debt, while Ushs 16.207 trillion is domestic debt (USD $4.2 billion). In terms of shares, external debt takes the largest share of total public debt at 66% while domestic debt is 34o/o of total public debt.\n\nThe estimated nominal debt as a percentage of GDP as at end June 2019 stood at 37%, increasing the risks of public debt sustainability if the productive capacity of the economy grows at a much lower rate, while the Present Value (PV) of public sector debt to GDP stood at 27 .29% as of end June 2019. This is relatively below the Public Debt Management Framework threshold of 50 per cent.\n\nThis investigative website understands that Parliament\u2019s Committee on National Economy on the proposal by government to borrow money for the expressway, has equally endorsed Museveni\u2019s directive to lock out the Chinese.\n\n\u201cThe Committee noted that there a number of companies that were trying to interfere with the procurement processes under this project, as noted by the President in his letter to the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, dated 17th May, 2020,\u201d the report reads in part.\n\n\u201dThe Committee recommends that bidders that interfered with the bidding processes during the implementation of this project should be disqualified, as directed by H.E. the President,\u201d the MPs decided.\n\nThe 38-member Parliament committee included Hon. Syda Bbumba Namirembe (Nakaseke North), Hon. Lawrence Bategeka (Hoima Municipality), Hon Thomas Tayebwa (Ruhinda North) and Hon. Aston Kajara Mwenge South among others.\n\nDetails of the Expressway:\n\nThe tentative interest cost of the ADB loan at 2.25% per annum on the loan disbursed is lower than the standard discount rate used of 5% recommended by IMF and World Bank.\n\nThis implies that the tentative present value of the loan (US$ 109.04 million) is typically smaller than the nominal value of the loan contracted (US$ 229.47 million).\n\nThis implies that the country\u2019s total future payment for this loan is cheaper than the proposed amount to be borrowed in present terms. The loan is highly concessional, since its tentative grant element 52%o is larger than the threshold of 35%, recommended by IMF/World Bank. The concessionality of this loan is further influenced by its long maturity and grace period.\n\nThe Project is a PPP Availability based Design, Build, Finance, Operate, Maintain and Transfer (DBFOT) from Government to a private Concessionaire over a concession period of 30 years.\n\nThe project is allotted to a single Concessionaire but implemented in phases as follows:\n\nPhase 1 / Lot 1: 53km urban expressway divided into two sections\n\nSection 7 comprising the Kampala Southern Bypass (KSB) an 18km dual Urban Expressway of 2X2lanes with design speed up to 100kph which connects with the Kampala-Jinja Mainline Expressway and the newly constructed Kampala-Entebbe Highway.\n\nSection 2 runs 35km along the Northern corridor from Kampala Central Business District to Namagunga with first 3km being 4\u00d74 lanes, and remaining sections being 3\u00d73 lanes for a design speed of up to 120kph.\n\nPhase 2 | Lot 2: Section 3 is the last stretch of the Kampala-Jinja mainline expressway covering the remaining 42km from Namagunga, ending at Jinja where it interfaces with the recently constructed New Nile Bridge.\n\nThis component also comprises construction of several major structures including viaducts, grade separate interchanges and tolling stations; plus up to 30km of ancillary roads.\n\nBudgetary Implication\n\nThe project is part of the approved Public Investment Plan with an approved estimate provision totalling Shs 388,909,215,000.\n\nThe project is also included in the FY 2020121 draft budget estimates for Uganda National Roads Authority (Project code 1278 under Vote 113) with a provision of Shs 3,442,049,000 under Government development budget of the project to largely support payment of contract staff salaries and other staff benefits under the project.\n\nUganda will mobilize USD 300.17 million (19% of total project cost) as counterpart funds for the project towards the right of way clearance (Compensation of Project Affected Persons) for the project.\n\nThe African Development Bank and the Agence Francaise de Development (AFD) will provide 15% (USD 229.46 million) and 7% (USD 105 million) of the project cost that will be borrowed by government in form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) as its contribution for phase 1 of the project.\n\nThe European Union will also provide 7% (USD 105 million) of the total project as a grant blended with the AFD funding for phase 1 VGF of the project. 13% (USD 200 million) and 8% (USD 120 million) of the project costs is debt/project finance divided into commercial tranche and DFI tranche respectively that will be mobilized by the concessionaire.\n\nIn addition, 11% of the costs will be financed by equity that will 1-6 mobilized by the concessionaire. 13% (USD 200 million) *% (USD 120 million) of the project costs will be raised through project financing (capital market) to be raised from the local and international capital markets in the form of bonds respectively to support the KJE SPV.\n\nEconomic and Financial Return\n\nOverall the project is expected to produces a net economic benefit of USD 2,062 million, at 12 % economic opportunity cost of capital (EOCK).The Economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the project over the concession life is projected at 29%. The financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of the project is 11.4%.\n\nThe economic benefits will accrue to four main stakeholders \u2013 road users, the Government of Uganda, local labour and the financial investors. As the road will be significantly improved, road users will be spending less on maintenance, fuel and oil, and wear and tear. The government is expected to benefit directly through tax and expected additional revenues from the executing agency (UNRA).", "link": "https://chimpreports.com/investigation-corruption-intimidation-why-museveni-is-blocking-chinas-cccc-from-1bn-kampala-jinja-expressway-deal/", "published": "2020-06-08T10:47:41+03:00"}, {"title": "PHOTOS: Dr Stella Nyanzi Hurt as Lover is Identified", "author": ["Https", "Chimpreports.Com Author Fred-Mwambu"], "text": "Controversial activist, Dr Stella Nyanzi, has expressed concern after her lover was identified on social media.\n\nNyanzi, a medical anthropologist, feminist, queer rights activist, and scholar of sexuality, family planning, and public health, has previously written about her great lover whose identity remained secret until this Thursday.\n\nThe young man has been identified as David Musiri, a People Power activist.\n\n\u201cWhen I freely expressed myself about unity of all the opposition in Uganda, I was insulted, threatened, ridiculed and condemned by members of my political party \u2013 the FDC.

Thinking like a child l asked myself questions like Will the Giraffe actually like me? When it sees me, will it act out? or Will it enjoy me feeding it?\n\nWe were given food pellets to feed the Giraffes by hand or if you prefer by mouth and they are always ready to feast on it. Which also an amazing experience.\n\nThis left me in awe! to be in the presence of the Giraffes, they were so many of them looking at me eye to eye. Amazing!\n\nI then pulled out my pellets to feed them they pulled out their black salivating touges. I feed them but they kept coming for more and more.\n\nThe staff are always passing around for you to ask a question.

Our guide warned to watch our steps.\n\nThe Waterfalls produce a beautiful sound with sounds of birds in the background, creating a peaceful environment for any traveler that is out to look for relaxation.\n\nOur guide explained that the water from the falls comes from the Rwenzori mountains.\n\nTo access the Amabere Ga Nyina Mwiru, everyone was charged Shs 7,500 and up to 41,000 for foreigners at the time.

and widen the scope of the income tax withholding agents across all sectors in order to broaden the tax base.\n\nDelivering the budget speech this Thursday at Parliament, Kasaija new measures would enhance rental income tax collection and compliance by implementing a digital collection solution, as well as gazette rental income tax chargeable in different geographical areas for taxpayers who do not voluntarily declare their rental income.\n\nExperts attribute low tax collection in Uganda to tax avoidance and evasion, partly resulting from generous tax exemptions to investors; inadequate administrative capacity; the presence of a large informal sector; weak checks and balances and the lack of social norms for tax compliance.\n\nA 2018 World Bank report showed Uganda could raise more domestic revenues to support its development.\n\nUganda\u2019s tax system is one of the most modern in the region, but revenue collections, at 14.3 percent of GDP, are low, and way below its tax potential.\n\nUp to 5 percent of GDP is lost annually in tax leakages. Personal income tax contributes roughly 18 percent of GDP compared to up to 40 percent in developed countries.\n\nSpeaking today, President Museveni attributed low revenue collections to corruption at Uganda Revenue Authority where senior officials were recently sacked.\n\n\u201cWe are paying a lot of money in interest because we are borrowing. This can be stopped if we pay taxes. There is a lot of collusion and people not paying taxes. This is corruption,\u201d said Museveni.\n\n\u201cThe rentals; this is cheating. Someone has over 40 units and he is claiming that he is building new ones. We are saying that pay tax for the houses. That is why we have very low tax collection,\u201d he added.\n\nKasaija said government would Gazette VAT withholding agents with an applicable VAT rate of 6 percent, and provide for penalties for failure to withhold; and also roll out the use of Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFDs), which are \u2013 cash registers interconnected to the Uganda Revenue Authority, to improve record keeping and tax compliance.\n\n\u201cThe domestic revenue measures for next financial year are anchored on the Domestic Revenue Mobilization Strategy (DRMS), which aims to mobilise sufficient revenue to support infrastructure development and social welfare. The Strategy balances competing challenges of increasing the revenue effort to support expenditure needs, while at the same time facilitating investment and industrialisation,\u201d said Kasaija.\n\nThe Strategy seeks to enhance revenue collection to finance the larger part of our Budget in the short, medium and long term and to create a tax system that is fair and transparent.\n\nIn view of the recent emergencies including floods, locust invasion and COVID-19, Kasaija said Government introduced modest adjustments in some taxes to raise revenue.\n\n\u201cThis will support enhanced economic recovery, as well as maintain an acceptable level of social welfare. Tax administration will be strengthened to improve efficiency in revenue collection. The capacity of local governments, including the roll out of the digital collection of fees and rates, will also be enhanced to improve local revenue generation,\u201d said the Minister.\n\nTargets\n\nNext financial year\u2019s revenue target is Shs 21,810 billion, comprised of tax revenue amounting to Shs 20,219 billion and non-tax revenue of Shs 1,591 billion. This target translates into a revenue effort of 14.3 percent of GDP.\n\nTo achieve this target, adjustments to tax rates have been made include the excise duty rate on fuel.\n\nHe said more adjustments were made to improve competitiveness in the region, support compliance, remove ambiguities in the legislations as well as close loopholes that may lead to revenue leakage.\n\nIn order to promote import substitution and the development of local industries, government has increased import duties on goods that are produced or can be produced locally. The import duty on agricultural products has been increased to 60 percent and other products to 35 percent.\n\nUntil recently, government has been importing refined industrial sugar yet Uganda is a surplus producer of sugar.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed with sugar manufacturers to produce refined industrial sugar locally and we shall protect them from imports,\u201d said Kasaija.\n\nThe Minister also spoke about supporting agriculture, saying VAT on the supply of agricultural equipment will be exempted.\n\nThe supply of processed milk will also be VAT exempt to enhance the price competitiveness of milk produced in Uganda.\n\n\u201cIn order to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic, taxes on supplies for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and management of the epidemics, pandemics and health hazards, will be exempt from customs duties,\u201d said Kasaija.", "link": "https://chimpreports.com/uganda-shifts-to-modern-digital-technologies-to-increase-tax-compliance/", "published": "2020-06-11T17:31:29+03:00"}, {"title": "COVID-19 Budget: Kasaija Defers Taxes for SMEs, Tourism, Manufacturing", "author": ["Https", "Chimpreports.Com Author Kim_A"], "text": "Finance Minister Matia Kasaija has listed tax reliefs for businesses which are struggling as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying the move will address the \u201cshort term emergency liquidity requirements of businesses, boost their cash-flows, and ensure business continuity.\u201d\n\nKasaija, in a budget speech being read at Parliament on Thursday, deferred payment of Corporate Income Tax or Presumptive tax for Corporations and Small, Medium Enterprises (SMEs).\n\n\u201cI am deferring until September 2020, the payment of any Corporate Income Tax and Presumptive Tax due 1st April 2020 to 30th June 2020, for tax complaint businesses with a turnover of less than Shs 500 million per annum,\u201d Kasaija\u2019s budget speech reads in part.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, no interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period.

He allowed the value of the donations the private sector made towards the Corona Virus Response.\n\nHe further revealed Uganda Revenue Authority would speed up payment of outstanding VAT refunds amounting to Ushs 120bn due to businesses accompanied by measures to limit fraud.\n\nFinancial Sector Stability\n\nIn order to ensure financial sector stability in support of the economy, Kasaija reiterated the Bank of Uganda\u2019s measures being implemented to mitigate risks to overall economic growth, and also ultimately support the financing of businesses.\n\nThese include providing for adequate capital buffers for supervised financial institutions to ensure effective operation by deferring payments of all discretionary dividends and bonus payments for at least 90 days effective March 24, 2020.\n\n\u201cThis preserves the capital of a financial institution and is intended to support the real economy,\u201d said Kasaija.\n\nOther measures include smoothening out volatility in the foreign exchange market arising from global financial markets; providing exceptional liquidity assistance for a period of up to one year to Supervised Financial Institutions that may need it; and waiving limitations on restructuring of credit facilities.\n\nSupervised Financial Institutions (SFIs) have been permitted to restructure loans and provide loan repayment holidays to companies and individuals affected by the Corona Virus pandemic; and\n\nKasaija said BoU would encourage the reduction of Mobile Money and other digital Transactions fees that are charged by Mobile Network Operators and commercial banks, in order to limit the use of cash and customer visits to banks.", "link": "https://chimpreports.com/covid-19-budget-kasaija-defers-taxes-for-smes-tourism-manufacturing/", "published": "2020-06-11T15:27:34+03:00"}, {"title": "Kasaija at Parliament to Read Shs 45.5tn Budget; Museveni Stays in Entebbe", "author": ["Https", "Chimpreports.Com Author Fred-Mwambu"], "text": "Finance Minister Matia Kasaija has Thursday afternoon arrived at Kampala Serena Hotel where he will present the 2020/21 National Budget to Parliament.\n\nThe total budget is Shs 45.5 trillion, up from Shs 40.5 trillion of the 2019/20 budget.\n\nThe budget reading, which followed the passing of the Appropriation Bill 2020 by Parliament in April, starts at 2:00pm.\n\nAccording to the sector allocations, Works and Transport takes an allocation of shs 5.84 trillion followed by Security with an allocation of shs 4.504 trillion.\n\nInterest payments will take shs 4 trillion, Education shs 3.6 trillion, Health sector budget is shs 2.7 trillion while the Agriculture sector gets shs 1.324 trillion.\n\nParliament and economists have since urged government to adopt austerity measures to effectively utilize the limited public resources, with major focus productive sectors of the economy such as agriculture, trade and Industry, tourism, health, education and social development that will help in revamping the economy and the lives of citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe budget is expected to be funded by resources from domestic revenue amounting to shs21.7 trillion and domestic borrowing shs 3.55 trillion.\n\nEnergy and Mineral Development takes shs 2.6 trillion.\n\nThe budget which will come into effect on 1st July 2020 is an increase of 12.36 per cent compared to the approved resource envelope for the current financial year 2019/2020.\n\nThe total Domestic resources financing the coming financial year budget will constitute 72.5 percent while external funding will constitute 27.5 percent.\n\nParliament has since urged Government to strengthen the mobilization and collection of revenues, which have stagnated below 16 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the past years.\n\nPresidential press spokesperson Don Wanyama said Kasaija will deliver the Budget at Parliament, while the President will digitally address the MPs and the country from State House Entebbe.", "link": "https://chimpreports.com/kasaija-at-parliament-to-read-shs-45-5tn-budget-museveni-stays-in-entebbe/", "published": "2020-06-11T13:59:34+03:00"}, {"title": "Spice Diana Wins YouTube Silver Creator Award", "author": ["Https", "Chimpreports.Com Author Michael-Nteza"], "text": "Musician Hajjara Namukwaaya alias Spice Diana, over the weekend received a You Tube Silver creator Award after hitting (100,000) one hundred thousand subscribers on her You Tube Account.\n\nSpice shared this joy with her fans via a statement on her social media platforms adding that she is now targeting the Gold Creator Award, which requires one to surpass one million subscribers.\n\n\u201cHey family we got it.

I know he believes in the strength of uniting with other diehard opposition factions such as the People Power movement,\u201d said Nyanzi.\n\n\u201cAnd so I wonder why it is taking him long to negotiate a fair, just and equitable unity with Hon Robert Kyagulanyi. The two men have a recent history of friendship and comradeship. Each has supported the other during state-instigated torture and human rights violations. What is preventing the unity of the two opposition formations led by these leaders?\u201d she wondered.\n\nHowever, Nyanzi\u2019s remarks were perceived as disrespectful towards Besigye who worked day and night to rescue her from Luzira Prison.\n\nChimpReports understands Nyanzi has for long been close to Dr Besigye.\n\nWhen he visited Nyanzi at Luzira Prison, she kept telling him that he was the only one who could stand with her in all situations.\n\nShe said Besigye was like her father.\n\nBesigye always visited and comforted Nyanzi\u2019s children when their mother was jailed at Luzira.\n\nApparently, Nyanzi intends to stand on the People Power ticket for her MP bid.\n\nHowever, relations between supporters of People Power and FDC are tense with many exchanging abuses on social media.\n\nSamuel Makokha, an FDC fanatic, told ChimpReports that Nyanzi and her fans \u201cthink that Besigye\u2019s supporters can automatically support Bobi Wine, this is impossible.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, this is not the first time FDC is being urged to unite with other political forces to put a strong challenge against Museveni.\n\nThe TDA political vehicle aimed at rallying opposition forces together in the 2016 polls flopped with FDC saying they could hardly trust Amama Mbabazi to lead the joint force.\n\nFormer spy chief Lt Gen Henry Tumukunde also recently reiterated the need for a stronger and united opposition to force Museveni out of power.\n\n\u201cI would like to send a message to members of the opposition including those in the ruling party with alternative views that all we suffer can be ended through a united front to achieve change in this country,\u201d said Tumukunde.\n\n\u201cI wish to remind you that we are six months away from scheduled general elections of 2021,\u201d he added.\n\nOpportunism?\n\nPolitical analyst and researcher, Bernard Sabiiti described Nyanzi\u2019s scheme as \u201cpure political opportunism.\u201d\n\nSabiiti said Nyanzi knows if FDC and People Power each fielded a candidate for Kampala Woman MP, a position she is already covertly campaigning for, she will be placed between a rock and hard place.\n\n\u201cWhich flag does she seek nomination for? If she chooses FDC, People Power fanatics will be mad and field their own candidate. The split in that vote could all but ensure victory by an NRM flag-bearer,\u201d said Sabiiti.\n\n\u201cSo it is a case of damned if she does and damned if she doesn\u2019t. Nyanzi\u2019s chances of winning will be slim if she stands on either ticket and the other party also fields a candidate. This is her dilemma.\u201d\n\nSabiiti emphasised that Nyanzi\u2019s current crusade for Besigye and Bobi Wine unity is not just about opposition unity\u2019s sake, but also the fact that Besigye and Bobi uniting benefits her political ambitions greatly.\n\n\u201cNyanzi can claim neutrality as both sides will think she is well intentioned arbiter of unity between the two biggest opportunist groups in the country so she is able to have her cake and eat it too,\u201d said Sabiiti.\n\nSabiiti said it won\u2019t be too long in case Nyanzi mission fails and will have to pick one of the two hence being cooked.\n\nSeveral observers said FDC remained selfish, leading to disjointed forces which the president continues to defeat in every election.\n\nIn response, Makokha told ChimpReports: \u201cThere has never been a disjointed effort as far as Ugandan voters are concerned. Uganda\u2019s presidential race has always been a two-horse race.\u201d\n\nTowards the 2016 polls, MP Nabilah Naggayi attempted to run on Mbabazi\u2019s \u2018Go Forward\u2019 ticket only to change her mind at the last minute.\n\nIt remains unclear why Nyanzi said Besigye, a former presidential candidate and opposition leader should \u201cnegotiate\u201d unity with Bobi, a political amateur whose countrywide appeal is yet to be tested.\n\nSabiiti said Nyanzi is putting the onus on Besigye to be the one uniting with Bobi and not the other way round \u201cbecause she has read the current political temperature in Kampala\u201d and realizes that right now People Power is a bigger force in Kampala than FDC/Besigye.\n\n\u201cWere she to call on Bobi to join Besigye, she knows she would be in trouble as People Power diehards would roast her. Besigye being a more mature politician, will play it cool. He will ignore her but will not publicly express anger against her,\u201d said Sabiiti.", "link": "https://chimpreports.com/stella-nyanzi-tests-ugandas-murky-political-waters-with-call-for-besigye-bobi-wine-alliance/", "published": "2020-06-10T10:56:21+03:00"}, {"title": "BIG STORY: Museveni Orders Gen Odong: Don\u2019t Renew NIRA Boss Obitre\u2013Gama\u2019s Contract", "author": ["Https", "Chimpreports.Com Author Giles"], "text": "President Museveni has directed that the employment contract of National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) Executive Director, Judy Obitre\u2013Gama, should not be renewed.\n\n\u201cI have been informed that the contract of the current Executive Director is due to expire,\u201d Museveni said in a letter to Internal Affairs Minister Gen Jeje Odong on May 18.\n\n\u201cGiven the problems faced by NIRA especially, relatin to the issuance of national identity cards, there is a need to identify a new Executive Director preferably with a legal or information technology background.\u201d\n\nJudy Obitre\u2013Gama has presided over the troubled institution since May 2015.\n\nShe, however, blames understaffing and inadequate resources for NIRA\u2019s poor performance.\n\nDespite complaints from the public over poor service delivery, the institution has not registered any tangible improvement.\n\nMinister Odong recently said the surging crowds at NIRA offices in Kololo were symptomatic of the inefficiency of the agency.\n\nMost of the challenges affecting the authority include inadequate equipment, poor coordination between NIRA staff and the district coordination committee members.\n\nOther challenges are limited facilitation, limited office accommodation, unbalanced and unfavourable payment structures, inadequate understanding of NIRA activities and services by the local communities, and a considerable disparity between the approved budget and the overall performance of the project.\n\nIn 2019, MP Odonga Otto demanded from government a detailed procedure of acquiring or replacing a national identity card.\n\n\u201cThe ordinary person has to come to the NIRA centre that is functional in Kampala.

It is strong and admired because of you \u2013 the staff and volunteers. You make Oxfam the place it is.

It would be too expensive \u2013 the Buganda Government provided some scholarships.\n\nIt took decades of lobbying, agitating, and jumping through hoops for those graduates to \u2018earn\u2019 the title of \u2018Doctor\u2019 and to get international recognition.\n\nNow we seem to have come full circle.\n\nUgandan leaders have over time decided that Ugandan doctors are not good enough for them.

Wasn\u2019t that so much a time for anything to happen?\n\nIndeed, the cabinet held an extraordinary meeting to discuss \u2018the management of the situation following the unexpected death of Nkurunziza.\u201d\n\nWhile the meeting happened, certain officials went to court seeking for the declaration of a vacancy post in the presidency, while a strong \u2018crisis committee\u2019 sought to take charge of the matters.\n\nHowever in its judgment the court ruled that an interim period \u201cis not necessary\u201d.\n\nThe court also ruled that the country must \u201cproceed, as soon as possible, with the swearing-in of the president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye\u201d.\n\nNdayishimye was handpicked by ruling party to replace Nkurunziza, but does he have everyone\u2019s blessing , most especially the countries that border Burundi ?\n\nThe answer is a no.\n\nNkurunziza wanted someone else to succeed him\n\nAlready Nkurunziza had opted to be succeeded by the current speaker Pascal Nyabenda, but party big wigs opted for Ndayishimye and this brings the matter closer to a complication and could swell into a power struggle, now that the man who was holding strings is out of the picture.\n\nTruth be told, Nkurunziza, just like any other leader particularly in Africa, did not hold the power alone whether internally or externally, and worse still, he died before directly handing over.\n\nIn his last five years in office, Nkurunziza has been Museveni\u2019s pawn in dealing with Rwanda.\n\nMuseveni has enjoyed tight grip on South Sudan, and Burundi, and previously DRC before the exit of Joseph Kabila and the election of Felix Tshishekedi who has embarked on repairing relations with Rwanda.\n\nIn the region, Tanzania and Kenya are the countries that can flipflop on either side depending on the situation, while Burundi, South Sudan remain for the taking. DRC on the other hand is taking different strides.\n\nWooing DRC\n\nThe bigger aspect of Uganda and Rwanda trouble started in DRC, Museveni to some extent managed to neutralize Joseph Kabila and he had him as an ally, leaving Rwanda in the cold.\n\nTowards the inauguration of Tshishekedi, a rare picture of Museveni, Kabila and Tshishekedi at State House Entebbe was leaked and eyebrows were raised.\n\nCould Kabila have been offering Tshishekedi as a new ally to Museveni in his absence, yes. However, Tshishekedi turned off the script, after he was wooed by Kagame. The former took a full state visit to Kigali in March 2019 to the shock of many home and in Uganda.\n\nDuring the visit, Tshisekedi spoke against rebels at the border of DRC and Rwanda, a song with Kagame added his own verse.\n\n\u201cWe have to believe him (Tshisekedi). My problems in Rwanda very often end up being problems in the DRC, and vice versa. We can\u2019t address that without cooperation,\u201d Kagame said, and they sealed it with a big handshake.\n\nThings started moving fast, Rwanda was in no time operating their airline to Kinshasha six times a week, something that they had lobbied for with Kabila and failed miserably at it.\n\nKagame grew wings,closed the border with Uganda, and started clamoring for many things. That is the confidence that comes with the fact that one has received backing on one side.\n\nAmongst Rwanda\u2019s demands and accusations, they want Uganda to stop financing activities on subversion with in Rwanda via Burundi.\n\nRwanda have their own intel that Uganda is supporting rebels on the side bordering Burundi and Rwanda with the help on Nkurunziza, who by the way had publicly labeled Rwanda an enemy.\n\nIn a letter to Museveni (in his capacity as chairman EAC) in December 2018, Nkurunziza said he does not view Rwanda as a partner but an enemy.\n\nThe frosty relationship between Rwanda and Burundi started in May 2015 following a failed coup to unseat Nkurunziza who according to unconfirmed rumors landed in Kampala from Nairobi and returned to Bujumbura with Museveni\u2019s trusted security personnel who restored him to power.\n\nWhile Burundi accused Rwanda of engineering the coup and Nkurunziza continued to suspect Kagame of plotting to overthrow him, Museveni was brought closer and put in charge of mediations in Burundi.\n\nBurundi has indeed filed multiple reports to the EAC, UN and AU accusing Rwanda of supporting rebels opposed to Nkurunziza. They claim the rebels are on the border with DRC, whom Rwanda is wooing unceasingly.\n\nBurundi, Uganda\u2019s friend against Rwanda\n\nBurundi has played a significant role in frustrating Rwanda\u2019s actions against Uganda.\n\nWhile Rwanda closed borders with Uganda, Burundi closed its borders too, causing Rwanda to write to Uganda and Kenya over the same.\n\nRwanda in retaliation also blocked trucks proceeding to Burundi from Uganda, a move which Bujumbura government claimed was based on \u2018ill motivated interests against the government in Bujumbura.\u201d\n\n\u201cKigali seeks to deny Burundi essential supplies and suffocate our country into submission,\u201d an official from Burundi told Soft power news.\n\nTherefore, with Nkurunziza out of the picture, matters could harden for president Museveni, should someone else reach Burundi before him.", "link": "https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/06/13/musevenis-grip-on-region-loosens-with-nkurunziza-out-of-picture/", "published": "2020-06-13T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Gen.Muhoozi hails bare-knuckle, conventional Kasirye Ggwanga", "author": [], "text": "The Chief of Defence Forces, Gen.

To be employed is a good thing. You sell your skills and make a living. If a job comes with a high salary and perks, you even get to travel the world.\n\nThat\u2019s a good thing because many people, especially in the developing world, will never see any country physically other than the one where they were born and raised.\n\nYour monthly payment is your god. You may believe in the bigger, imaginary, and popular god, but the truth is that your real god is money. Your employment (or business) guarantees a steady supply of that god. The moment that god disappears, you\u2019ll starve\u2014or beg people for food. You won\u2019t be able to pay rent, you won\u2019t be able to consult a doctor. If you\u2019re a man, you may even fail to get it up.\n\nYet employment is not permanent, and employers aren\u2019t under any obligation to employ you forever. They can only employ you if they can pay you and they need your skills. If there\u2019s any disruption to their source(s) of revenue, they either ask you to leave or cut your salary. It\u2019s the right thing to do. Anyone running a business would do it.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the same happening in many places across the world since COVID-19 started unleashing its terror on humanity and brought economic activity to a near standstill.\n\nSome employees refuse to take pay cuts and protest. It\u2019s all too easy to see why they do that. Many have never employed anyone, and they think that organisations/companies that employ them can still pay them even when they aren\u2019t making any money. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nFor those who can sell their skills to other employers and still earn the same or even higher pay, there\u2019s no need to continue working if your salary is cut. But those who protest and stop working amaze and amuse me. They\u2019re basically saying: \u201cYes, we know you aren\u2019t making money, but you still have to pay us the same salaries we\u2019ve always been paid.\u201d\n\nThey threaten to quit forgetting that the easiest thing to do for many employers is to find employees to replace those who have quit. In nearly all places, vacancies are vastly outnumbered by job seekers. It\u2019s rare for a really good job to attract just one applicant even if the employer is known to treat workers like doormats. People quit jobs where they\u2019ve not been paid for months, and there will be dozens lining up to take up those jobs.\n\nI\u2019ll end my post with a good example I saw many years ago when I was a young journalist. Three years after Uganda\u2019s second-largest newspaper, Daily Monitor, was launched, all its topnotch journalists\u2014about 12\u2014quit over poor remuneration and launched a new paper. They called it The Crusader.\n\nIt was a good paper, and it did well for a couple of years. Unfortunately, it folded and some of the journalists who quit Daily Monitor ended up going back because they couldn\u2019t find a good employer.\n\nDaily Monitor didn\u2019t have any difficulty replacing the journalists who quit. It went to campus, as Ugandans call Makerere University, and hired new reporters and editors.\n\nBy the time The Crusader disappeared from the newsstands, Daily Monitor\u2019s new journalists were able to do what those who quit launching The Crusader were able to do.\n\nMoral: Employees and employers need each other, but employers always have the upper hand. If you don\u2019t know that, you\u2019re very naive.\n\nThe author is a journalist/social commentator", "link": "https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/06/11/opinion-a-lesson-for-people-who-dont-work-for-themselves/", "published": "2020-06-11T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Coronavirus outbreak now a business venture for Uganda's political elite", "author": [], "text": "BY RICHARD MBAYO\n\nIt was on the 31 of December 2019 when China and the World Health Organisation (WHO) publicly declared the outbreak of COVID-19 and where it started as disease, went to Italy as a global pandemic, and arrived in Uganda has become a business venture for the country\u2019s political elite.\n\nMuch has been said, discussed on COVID-19 ranging from the publications, WHO declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on 11th March when the disease had spread over the world.\n\nUganda reported her first case of COVID-19 on the 19th of March which was strange because many countries, the first case were foreign cases but it was unique for Uganda whose first case was a Ugandan businessman who had traveled to Dubai for a Business transaction.\n\nThe Ugandan government issued guidelines which included lockdown of the country, closure of national borders, Entebbe International Airport, banning of public transportation, public gatherings, and later on curfew was implemented.\n\nCOVID-19 arrived in Pearl of Africa as Business Venture for political elites whereby the executive arm of government presented a request for a supplementary budget on the flow of parliament and in April, enormously Parliament approved the supplementary budget of shs.284 billion which was aimed at fighting COVID-19, the share of the budget was allocated to Security 77.4bn, Local government 36.1bn, ministry of Health received shs.109.1bn, a 59b Shillings was allocated to the office of the Prime Minister as COVID-19 food relief to support 1.6 poor urban residents and 2bn to KCCA.\n\nAs it has been the case for the ruling NRM party MPs and Ministers and President himself dominated the media whereby he has been given free reception any time of the day, the President could inform the public about his press conferences while opposition leaders are shrinking from their homes and it is illegal for Opposition MPs to supply food to his/her constituents as it was witnessed withalleged torture of Hon. Francis Zaake of Mityana Municipalitywho was one of the culprits as he was arrested for defying the presidential directive while NRM MPs and Ministers remaineduntouchableas they were free to distribute food and other resources.\n\nThe 59b shillings COVID-19 food relief funds which were meant for purchasing food for the poor urban residents in Kampala Metropolitan Area( Kampala, Wakiso, and Mukono) landed in the hands of corrupt officials in the OPM which later led to the arrest of four top government officials in April by Anti-Corruption Committee led by Edith Nakalema from the State House for inflating food prices, purchase of expired milk, beans and posho which was substandard, raised questions onhow bidding for a contract to supply food which was given to Aponye left many Ugandans wondering how and when did the OPM call for bidding and what was the procedure of selecting the best bidder who won the contract of supplying COVID-19 Food Relief?\n\nThis later led to the President\u2019s call for public support and many Companies, International donors and individuals responded to the President\u2019s call by donating items which included over 100 empty jerricans by Coco-cola which went viral as the public questioned company\u2019s donations, followed by 1bn donation by Pepsi and so on.\n\nThe shs.10bn cash bonanza shared among Parliamentarians led to an exchange of fire among the country\u2019s arms of government where the Executive (President) publicly blamed and criticized Parliament for sharing money in a critical time and later Judiciary forced all MPs to vomit 20M Ug Shillings by returning it to National Treasury or donating to District COVID Taskforces. This shs.10b ended the honeymoon between Parliament and Executive as the head of Legislature called upon the general public to ask for accountability not only from Parliament but even Executive.\n\nThe shs.40M handshake which was dished to 317 NRM MPs who passed the motion for honoring President Museveni for his tactics and measures on COVID-19 left a lot to be desired among the public because it was the same president who blamed the parliament for sharing 20M, he later rewarded his NRM MPs with 40M which was controversialwhen the local masses needed support, the political elites were enjoying life.\n\nMany Ugandan artistes and musicians stormed studios and recorded COVID songs which helped in creating awareness among the masses about the global pandemic. However, the most outstanding songs were Corona Distance by Bebe Cool and Coronavirus Alert by HE Bobi Wine and Nubian Li and the later song went viral globally as it was quoted by Guardian the UK\u2019s leading media and Al Jazeera reported howUgandan Popstar Bobi Wineused music tosensitize Masses to Sanitize.\n\nThe government move that required all Ministers to test for COVID-19 and go into isolation is being viewed by many Ugandans as Politically Motivated move by the government to shy away from its responsibilities for extending support tovulnerable citizensespecially with food relief as the country eased lockdown measures.\n\nIn a nutshell, therefore, the COVID-19 which started in China as a disease, went to Italy as a global pandemic as it installed fear among the people across the globe, while Uganda\u2019s politicians welcomed it as an opportunity to loot from the needy as it has been the case as the masses are still wonderinghow the government spent billions of shillings on invisible locusts, COVID-19 has fertilized the ground for the Executive to dominate the media, making promises like free masks to citizens and the latest to give 2 television sets to each village to help village children access Education. In the meantime with the country\u2019s general election due to 2021, opposition leaders have limited access to the public and media.\n\nRichard Mbayo is a Graduate Student at Silk Road School, Renmin University of China.

Proving your relevance as a professional is starting to become an absolute necessity.\n\nThere are now no two-ways about it whether you run your kiosk, or represent a multi-national as its overall Team Lead to managing a client\u2019s account in an advertising firm to implementing a humanitarian type project for a UN-related agency.\n\nThe cat is out of the bag and vast budgets are being minimized for key and \u201cimportant\u201d staff as well as the ones who actually do the work for the company and when they are off, work generally becomes hard to do based on technical ability, willingness to work and general attitude in getting things done.\n\nOver the past 60 to 90 days, there has been a surge in online meetings and workshops through Zoom calls, Google Hang Out, Microsoft Teams, and a host of others.\n\nThose meetings are skewed towards frequent updates, budget adjustments, and actual information sharing on various post-COVID interventions in one\u2019s geographical space of choice.\n\nFor those of us (you reading as well) who were not regular attendees of such online exertions, there has been time aplenty for some curious soul-searching. Intentional deep thoughts about how the change of work models affects you and me specifically.\n\nDr. Xavier is a close friend who studied and practiced Veterinary Medicine for 7 years and changed careers by learning how to code software and upped his programming skills in C, C#, ASP.NET, Java, PHP, Javascript, CSS5, HTML5 as well as becoming adept at Linux networking with Apache and MySQL.\n\nHe has always been a wide reader and is a good writer let alone a great tutor/ teacher of various subjects from STEM-based ones including Physics, Mathematics, and Biology to English and Literature in English as well.\n\nI know he is reading this and can comfortably say he is a cross between a techie and a lawyer wrapped up in one. Knowledgeable across the board on umpteen topics and a good problem solver. A week ago, on a social media chatting platform, he intimated to me in a sort of lamentation, that he is tired.\n\nWhen I probed further, he said that his good-naturedness is affecting his cashflow. He has been quite engaged during this lockdown tutoring a few colleagues\u2019 children on science subjects and not earning decent enough payments.\n\nHe said his coding skills should be being referenced enough for him to get work that should have helped roof his upcoming house, but alas\u2026 Long and short of it is that he is tired of being taken advantage of and wants practical ways to helpfully monetize his skills.\n\nFor many of us, this will (if it is not already) become the existing reality. The future of work is happening now and if we (you and me) are not careful, we may be rendered partially irrelevant for now until your own innate and learned skills can be monetized well enough for you to earn a living of sorts.\n\nSo when Dr. X asked me the question, \u201cEdmund, how do you convert a skill into money? I\u2019m not making money from this sh*t and I\u2019m tired, Edmund. I\u2019m tired.\u201d I told him it will need a little more than a chat session in Telegram or WhatsApp.\n\nSo Dr. X, as I write this, it is not only for you, it is for many of us who are also tired of having much-needed earnings always being lower than what we always negotiate for.\n\nThese four questions can endeavor to offer some guidance in answering your question.\n\nAre your skills worth being paid for (monetizing)? What exactly are your skills anyway? Would you pay someone like yourself a worthy rate for their skills if you were that person? What dictates your costing methodology?\n\nIt is true that most of us have been taught to sell something else (products and services) as opposed to selling ourselves. The closest we come to this is when writing a CV for a job application.\n\nOr at best when selling something for someone, you are noticed. Creative types always seem less interested in selling and keener to spend time on their craft as it is their chosen escape away from selling themselves.\n\nThe belief that their skills should sell them is being challenged every day and is the main gist of this article.\n\nAs I delve into the tips that can help you monetize your skills, always remember that your skills are looking to help solve a problem for somebody.\n\nWhether you are solving an entrepreneur\u2019s need for shared IP services or tutoring a student grappling with quadratic equations, let these tips help you to monetize your skills:\n\nONE: Develop a product and/ or service catalogue\n\nDo not let a client (potential or existing) misunderstand your offering. In today\u2019s ever-present technology-age, it is imperative that having e-documents showing your products is clear.\n\nThis can be on a separate Facebook page, a website if you are keen, or even just having e-brochures done by you and a fancy graphics guru who can make you and your skills appear world class and thus professional.\n\nMany a time, we get a raw deal because the client (again potential or existing) cannot see us in the same light as the standard in his/ her mind. For Dr. X, he can create a one-page tutoring profile with a basic flow of what it entails and how each student benefits.\n\nE.g. Review of overall subjects strength for student| identify weak and strong points| do initial tests| focus on overall student well-being| key exam tricks used to pass in top 15%| hours expected to put in| charges per hour|no discounts offered**| face to face sessions.\n\nWhat I have shared is basic, and can be improved further, but just going to show that the potential client understands the skill you are sharing and it will require monetary (money) to exchange hands for value added.\n\nTWO:Choose who you really want to help\n\nAt BLEGSCOPE now, I use many of the same business development and communications skills that I have been exposed to throughout my life. The biggest difference now is that I am a little choosier with who I selectively help. Yes, you may say we are trying to monetize our skills, but sometimes who you help is not always about money alone. It could be a small reminder of you at a certain age and you had no such assistance at the time. >>If you pick your industry based only on how much money you think you can make, then you can expect to always be chasing the money. << Helping others while getting paid is truly a blessing and in some unusual way, the world somehow conspires to pay you positively back for that help you rendered. You should notice that when the point comes when you do not believe in the outcomes you are being asked to work on, you may never enjoy your professional life.\n\nTHREE: Build the necessary confidence to believe that you can earn great money.\n\nI have seen how low confidence can make you make a different and often wrong decision and eventually take a disastrous decision to bring money and rewards your way.\n\nMark you, most of us are not born with confidence. It is bold actions that lead to feelings of certainty. To build a lucrative career, we should be able to communicate in assuring ways that do not come across as arrogant or egotistic, but ways that clearly illustrate why you should be hired and your special skills utilised.\n\nIf courage escapes from you, how do you stand apart from the competition and show that what you do is crucial, why should anyone pay you what you ask for?\n\nFOUR: Create the Demand\n\nI can in no clearer terms say that if you tell me there is no demand for what you do, then you may not be looking hard enough . At one point in time in my country, there was such high demand for ringtones of famous musicians such that when somebody called you on your mobile phone, they would hear your chosen musician\u2019s song. Now, it still exists, but not at the crazy rate of uptake of almost a decade ago. There are always new trends coming up, but the underlying currents always stay the same. If you learn how to notice the currents and take cleverly calculated (or not) risks, you can win even bigger than you have previously been winning. So if you\u2019re itching to create something different and you see no demand for it, think of creative ways to test it out before you give up.\n\nUgandan robot-aficionado Solomon King regularly writes about his work/ projects on various platforms including Medium, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. In doing so, he keeps the world up to date with many projects (monetary or otherwise) that he is doing and others he is keenly passionate about. Dr. X can choose a similar path as he is an avid reader and user of various technology platforms. Possibly writing about interesting projects being worked on and a potential client could relate and pick you up on that vibe. All in all, do not hesitate to throw away your CV focus and bring out more of who you are and what you have done and using various online platforms to enable this. I am not sure how much time recruiters spend on various online platforms like Facebook, but I know for sure they spend less than a minute on a CV.\n\nFIVE: Learn to speak about money with clients without emotion getting in the way\n\nEarlier on I asked a question about what dictates a costing methodology. This alone may cause you some anxiety.\u201d Edmund, can you make it simpler?\u201d A service is based on expertise gained through past experiences and technical knowledge accumulated over time.\n\nHow do I cost my Master\u2019s degree I did a decade ago?\n\nHow do I cost skills I learned 2 years ago on a similar project?\n\nI will not answer those two questions, but I will say that like sex, politics . and religion, money is a topic that we are advised to not speak about in polite company.\n\nI removed politics from that list because it is easier now to debate on many political issues now than it was a decade or two ago. But for money, you never share your salary with your colleagues; you do not brag about your net worth\u2019 and try not to ask your friends about their rent or how much they spent on their home, even if it puts your budget in perspective.\n\nLearning about money is intimidating, and there\u2019s no structural system in place to teach us. Further still, we look at poor money skills as something to be ashamed and embarrassed about, which can keep us from being honest about money and seeking out the right kind of help.\n\nI have learned that writing down figures for clients and presenting them on paper is a much more subtle way to let a figure sink into their minds and evaluate how it fits into their spending patterns.\n\nAllowing a minimum room for negotiation helps if you cost slightly higher and the client negotiates you lower to your preferred range. Either way, timidity will be recognized and you will be taken to the cleaners if your financial request is not confidently backed up by you. If you can create reasonable criteria that dictate this costing formula, let it be your chosen route when negotiating. And always choose to seek a deal where you both lose something as negotiation is never fair.\n\nSome of us may have skills that we are finding hard to promote and monetize. This may not be bad, because you are free to have a creative hobby. But if you dream of doing what you love one day, and actually earning cash-money from it, this is a whole different story.\n\nMaybe it is writing people\u2019s CVs, or even painting portraits of people\n\nWHATEVER IT MAY BE, I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE MONETIZED YOUR SKILL ALREADY. Anonymous\n\nBefore you start saying \u201cthey were lucky\u201d OR \u201cthey had connections\u201d, just consider the fact that you do not know HOW they did it OR how HARD they worked to come up with different and many times crazy ideas and connections. If you think the key to modern success is hidden in the past, think again. Nowadays tradition is being challenged and broken with new and modern ways of execution driving the world. Every industry is changing at the speed of light to adapt to new practices, demands, and opportunities. It\u2019s not the case that you have to adapt to the world anymore because it\u2019s starting to adapt to us instead.

If one struggles the other is bound to struggle.\n\nWith the current travel restrictions due to coronavirus, many businesses in the tourism and aviation industry are struggling.\n\nMany are faced with the scare of folding up. The aviation industry will need about two years to get back onto its feet fully.\n\nEven when the travel restrictions are lifted, they\u2019ll have the physiological and financial impact of the pandemic to deal with.\n\nMost people will still be scared of traveling or won\u2019t have the money as other things will take priority hence won\u2019t travel. It will take time to heal from that fear.\n\nMy suggestion to him was, start nurturing the local market. He was quick to point out that the local market wasn\u2019t as lucrative.\n\nMany locals don\u2019t travel let alone have the money to travel for adventure. I agree with this but this is so because tourism hasn\u2019t been sold to them.\n\nThe western markets we see were built over time.\n\nTravel is a habit that then grows into the culture. Its the responsibility of businesses in the tourism sector to nurture this habit and later turn it into a culture they can then earn from.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened in the west, they built from scratch, and now travel is a way of life.\n\nSomething they can\u2019t do without like going to church on Sunday for Christians or watching football on a weekend for football lovers.\n\nYou are taught into this and doing it repeatedly it becomes a part of who you.\n\nMany times we say Ugandans don\u2019t save but surely they do.\n\nAt least they spend the little they have which is good for any market. Spending on tourism isn\u2019t just high up on their priorities of expenditure.\n\nThey spend on drinking, they spend on cars, they spend on building, marrying, and other things that rank high on their priorities.\n\nIt will be upon tourism players to make sure they rank so high among those priorities. In the west buying a car isn\u2019t a bigger priority than traveling.\n\nI know it\u2019s not easy but it needs to be done. Any business that\u2019s building to last has to start with building its internal market (foundation) before it starts looking at other outside markets.\n\nIt\u2019s a hard job and may take years but they need to start from somewhere.\n\nHow do you have some of that money Ugandans spend on other things get spent on you too? The best way to do this is to educate them about your business and relate it to their lives and how it\u2019s important.\n\nWe have had to do this as a company (YOUNG TREPS).\n\nBefore launching we surveyed business consulting in Uganda and the results weren\u2019t that encouraging.\n\nI don\u2019t recall the exact figures but less than 15% thought consulting was important and even went ahead to pay for it.\n\nAbout 55% thought it wasn\u2019t all that necessary and worth paying for.\n\nIn short, we concluded we were dealing with a market that didn\u2019t appreciate the service we were looking to offer and this was majorly due to lack of knowledge.\n\nWe accepted that people can\u2019t appreciate what they don\u2019t understand. So we set out to use customer education as a marketing tool.\n\nLike Steve Jobs once reckoned, \u201cthe best and most effective marketing strategy is educating your clients.\u201d\n\nSo we started a blog and all we did for a whole year was write about business. Enlightening people on what we called \u201cthe other way\u201d of doing things/business.\n\nWe compared our way to their way. Now they had something to compare with.\n\nNow they had a new perspective because all along all they knew was their old way. Now we had a new way and slowly by slowly they started seeing the difference and asking themselves the critical questions from a more informed position.\n\nDuring that process, I wrote about three posts/articles a day, 90 a month, and 1,080 pieces a year.\n\nWe never asked anyone to come to buy anything but showed them what we called the other way of doing things through these pieces that touched on various topics from bookkeeping, formalisation, taxation, business planning, pricing, hiring, marketing among others.\n\nTwo years of dedicated education and we started seeing clients and inquiries. We set out to do the heavy lifting other than scramble for the few available clients in the market.\n\nBefore we started going after foreign clients, having a strong local base was vital for us.\n\nYou can\u2019t launch a missile from a canoe.\n\nI recall the days we didn\u2019t get people booking consultations even when they were free. Then we started seeing people and started pricing.\n\nWe started with 20k, 50k, and now 100k where we average at least 10 consultations a month and growing.\n\nThis has taken us over four years of focusing on educating and building our clientele from nothing. It\u2019s paid off, continues to pay off and I believe will be the pillar of our business growth going forward.\n\nBesides the consultations, we have people signing up for our main services like business registration because now they understand the value of doing so.\n\nThey understand the value of research because now they understand the need to understand the market before they dive right in.\n\nThey value accounting services because they now know why they should have their finances in order.\n\nI know it\u2019s easier to get out for already finished products/low hanging fruits (clients) but some times the easy way isn\u2019t the best way long term.\n\nMost times you have to go out and create your clients from scratch if you are looking at long term and sustainability.\n\nEducating your customers is the best way to do so and the best way to market.\n\nJaluum Herberts Luwizza is a Speaker,Writer, Columnist with the C.E.O Magazine and Contributor with the Nile Post.He is also a Business Consultant with YOUNG TREP East Africa\u2019s No.1 Business Management and Consultancy firm that helps people start and grow profitable businesses.\n\ntwitter:jaluwizza\n\n0700155232 | 0787555919 | whatsapp 0716223986.\n\nwww.theyoungtreps.com", "link": "https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/06/10/now-is-the-time-for-tourism-players-to-nurture-domestic-market/", "published": "2020-06-10T00:00:00"}, {"title": "La Liga returns in Spain", "author": [], "text": "Sevilla beat Real Betis in the Seville derby as La Liga returned after a three-month gap \u2013 with some teething problems off the pitch.\n\nGroups of fans ignored guidance as they gathered outside the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium before the game, and some of the TV presentations left plenty to be desired.\n\nBut in Lucas Ocampos the hosts had the key man to win the first match played in Spain since the coronavirus pandemic halted proceedings on 10 March.\n\nLa Liga is the second of Europe\u2019s big five leagues to resume, with the Premier League following suitnext week.\n\nAfter a minute\u2019s silence in memory of those who have died during the pandemic, La Liga returned with some new additions.\n\nAs previously heard in Germany, there was artificial crowd noise.

After the coup attempt in 2015, he moved from the then-capital, Bujumbura, to his northern hometown of Ngozi.\n\nThe two men\u2019s relationship ruptured in 2015 when Nkurunziza decided to seek a third term. Rufyikiri fled the country.\n\nSpeaking from exile in Switzerland, he added, \u201cMy wish for Burundi is not to go back into violence as we experienced in the past. \u2026 Whenever there is war, many people shed tears.\u201d\n\nNkurunziza had not intended to surrender all the privileges of leadership after leaving the presidency. The ruling CNDD-FDD party anointed him its Eternal Supreme Guide in 2018. The government said that when he stepped down, it would send him off with 1 billion Burundi francs \u2013 about $535,000 \u2013 plus a villa.", "link": "https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/06/10/the-complicated-legacy-burundis-pierre-nkurunziza-leaves-behind/", "published": "2020-06-10T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Uhuru, Ruto struggle up another notch as Kenyan VP stripped of more powers", "author": [], "text": "Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta has reorganised his government and stripped his deputy of power sharing privileges.\n\nThe revised executive order has raised sharp debate in Kenya \u2013 some say the changes are routine while others are convinced the Deputy President William Ruto is no longer viewed as a co-partner in running the country.\n\nThe presidency has changed its name to the executive office of the president.

When our partners fail to meet our expectations, we have a tendency to come up with reasons to explain their shortcomings. While it is your right to have your needs met, it is not your responsibility to make a particular man meet them. If you find yourself heavily focused on the latter in your relationship, here are 5 questions to ask yourself.\n\n1. Do I want to partner or possess?\n\nA partnership is like a yoke, the wooden cross piece that joins two animals moving in the same direction at the same pace in a joint effort. There is a natural element of reciprocity there. No one is dragging the other along; you were both already headed the same way and carrying the same load, now you\u2019re doing so together.\n\nPossession, on the other hand, is the state of owning or controlling something.\n\nThink of the many possessions and baggage that you may already have in your life, why choose a grown man to take on as a chore? Why exert additional effort forcing someone to do things? Imagine a partner who willingly decides to join your life and then helps you carry the load. That is partnership.\n\n2. How does he treat me?\n\nAction is the physical manifestation of how your partner truly feels about you. If you find yourself continually stressing and searching for the intention behind a man\u2019s actions, consider that his actions have already revealed everything you need to know. How he treats you indicates how he values you. It\u2019s your choice to take it or leave it.\n\nConvincing someone to understand why you do not approve of their treatment prioritizes talk and excuses action. Have you ever told someone what to do step by step until it became so mentally exhausting that you should have just done it yourself? Instead of teaching him how to treat you, say less and reclaim your focus. Incorporate your own advice into how you treat yourself.\n\n3. How can he be happy if I\u2019m not?\n\nAnything a man must do in order for you to be happy is misplaced security. Very quickly, you will discover that he continues to move through life prioritizing his individual happiness while you are left feeling unsettled every time he appears to be happy without you. His happiness is about him. Your happiness is about you. Find new reasons to smile and recognize that he was never your source.\n\n4. How content am I without him?\n\nHave you grown comfortable in your misery? Do you believe your man is supposed to get on your nerves? Has he become more of an inconvenience and, oftentimes, a disappointment in your life? I\u2019ll raise my hand so you don\u2019t have to.\n\nI\u2019ve cried over a man until I was literally challenged by a close friend to list how my life had become worse off without him post break-up. Eventually, my own tears became tired of me and dried out. I was concentrating so hard and still couldn\u2019t list one single thing.\n\nI allowed this man to become my pain to the point I no longer recognized pleasure. I had believed our drama would turn testimonial and I would be able to have a \u201cwe had to go through hell and high water to get here\u201d love story. My hell and high water lasted the entire duration of the relationship to the point it became the definition of it. Pain is not a relationship rite of passage.\n\n5. Can he do better without me?\n\nIf your reaction is \u201cAbsolutely not, I\u2019m the best thing that ever did and ever will happen to him, I blessed his life, beyond measure\u2026\u201d and so on and so forth, I hear you, Still, I ask you to consider how much credit you\u2019re giving yourself for his existence. No person is the purpose of another human being\u2019s existence. And the same goes for you. It is up to you how you fare in life, with or without him.\n\nTake a step back and look at how much energy you are investing into developing him to become the perfect man for you. Stop and focus on developing yourself instead.", "link": "https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/06/07/five-questions-a-woman-should-ask-herself-before-attempting-to-control-a-man/", "published": "2020-06-07T00:00:00"}, {"title": "10 non-sexual things women wish their men did more", "author": [], "text": "Do any women out there feel deprived of a lot of non-sexual physical touch that would feel really nice? And that our partners just don\u2019t do enough for some reason? And, by the way fellas, receiving regular physical affection throughout the day makes us feel closer to you and makes us more likely to want to have sex, when the time is right.\n\nHere are 10 non sexual things that women wish their men could do more!\n\nPlaying with our hair\n\nAh. I love it when my dude plays with my hair. If he just runs his fingers through it while we\u2019re watching TV, or twirls it between his fingers, or puts both his hands deep in it while kissing me. There are so many nerve endings on the head\u2014it just feels really nice.\n\nTucking us in bed\n\nDon\u2019t forget about the classic tuck-in. Those don\u2019t have to be over after childhood. It\u2019s so comforting to have your partner tuck you in. Even if he isn\u2019t yet ready to go to sleep, if you get in bed, and he sits on the side of it, just loving you, touching your face, and cuddling you a little while you doze off\u2014it\u2019s the best.\n\nA shoulder rub\n\nWhat I wouldn\u2019t give to just have my partner come around once a day and rub my shoulders while I work. And not in a way that\u2019s meant to lead to sex. Just a nice, deep shoulder rub to get the tension out and make me feel relaxed and happy. Men, please do this more.\n\nFoot rubs\n\nI understand that some men don\u2019t like feet. On the other hand, some men specifically love feet. So those dudes have to be careful to not turn all foot play into sex stuff. But a foot rub feels so nice and it\u2019s also very intimate. You really can\u2019t do anything while a man rubs your feet so it\u2019s total relaxation. And it\u2019s intimate because it\u2019s not like you let just anybody touch your feet.\n\nGiving a lady a bath\n\nDon\u2019t knock it \u2018til you try it. Having your dude draw you a bath, and not get in it with you, trying to be kinky, is so nice. Then having him sit on the side of the tub and sponge you down or massage your arms. Ahhh. It\u2019s the best. Bust most times when dudes raw a bath, they\u2019re trying to f*&k in that bath.\n\nSitting on your lap\n\nIs it just me or do men have a low tolerance for having a woman on their lap? Whenever I sit on my partner\u2019s lap, he starts squiring around within 45 seconds and complaining he can\u2019t get comfortable. To be clear, I\u2019m 5\u20197\u201d 118 lbs. I\u2019m light! And I feel close to my man when I sit on his lap and he puts his arms around me. Can\u2019t we do that more? Like, for a whole hang session with friends?\n\nA ton of cheek kisses\n\nYou know when a guy just plants a bunch of kisses all over your face? When you love him, it\u2019s the best feeling in the world. Every kiss comes with this little explosion of happy chemicals! And if he has a little scruff, even better. Men, do this for your women more!\n\nPicking us up\n\nI understand that this isn\u2019t always plausible and is highly dependent on the strength and build of both individuals. But, gentlemen, if you are able to pick up your partner, pick her up sometimes. Pick her up and carry her to bed. Pick her up and give her a bear hug. We feel so loved by you when you pick us up.\n\nHolding our hands while watching TV\n\nIt\u2019s sweet when a guy holds your hand while you walk, or while dragging you through a crowd so he doesn\u2019t lose track of you. But what about just holding both of our hands, while we\u2019re watching a movie or relaxing? That\u2019s very intimate because it isn\u2019t about the functionality of keeping track of each other in a crowded space. It\u2019s just about love.\n\nHelping us get dressed\n\nIf you see your partner struggling to get her skinny jeans off, have her sit down, stick her legs out, and you can pull them off for her. Or if you see her struggling to zip or button up a dress that closes in the back\u2014do it for her. It\u2019s this very intimate thing because you\u2019re helping us while touching us.", "link": "https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/06/03/10-non-sexual-things-women-wish-their-men-did-more/", "published": "2020-06-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Six signs your guy is still in touch with his side-dish during lockdown", "author": [], "text": "If you did suspect that your partner may have been dabbling in something outside of the relationship, it\u2019s not safe to assume that\u2019s over, just because you\u2019re all locked inside. If there\u2019s a history of infidelity or you sniffed something out before, know that these stressful times may have your partner looking for even more reasons to stray. Here are six signs a man is talking to his side-dish during quarantine.\n\nHe never leaves his phone\u2019s side\n\nHe\u2019s extremely attached to his phone. He never leaves it on a kitchen table or couch or side table for even a second. If he realizes he\u2019s almost done this, he rapidly backtracks, swoops it up, and puts it in his pocket. On the rare occasion he\u2019s misplaced his phone, he became panicked, and aggravated, accusing you of putting it somewhere.\n\nHe takes a lot of calls outside\n\nHe\u2019s always taking phone calls outside. He claims he just wants some fresh air and he\u2019s taking work calls out there, or calling his mom.\n\nThe rhythm is weird, too. Sometimes he\u2019ll come in from a long walk, his phone will ring, and he\u2019ll turn around to go right back outside. Could be a side-dish calling him right back after hanging up on him.\n\nHe takes some calls in the bathroom\n\nYou\u2019ve caught wind of the fact that he goes in the bathroom, turns on the shower, and then\u2026talks on the phone. Oh, and he locks the bathroom door during these times of course. There was a time when he\u2019d always leave the bathroom door open, in case you wanted to join him in the shower. But not so anymore.\n\nHe stays up late for no reason\n\nHe never comes to bed at the same time as you. He claims he has things to do. Like what? Nobody is doing anything. We are all under stay-at-home orders. There\u2019s a good chance the night hours, when you\u2019re asleep, are the best times for him to talk to his side-dish.\n\nHe\u2019s added extra passwords to his devices\n\nYou\u2019ve noticed that suddenly, if his laptop is left unattended for a minute, the screen locks and requires a password. And on his phone, new messages just come in as \u201cnew message\u201d rather than the content of the message or the name of the sender. You don\u2019t recall these security measures being in place before you two were stuck at home all day together.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t feel like having sex with you\n\nHe\u2019s got no sex drive going in your direction. You\u2019ve tried to initiate and he just says he isn\u2019t in the mood. He claims that the pandemic has him too stressed to have sex. But, honestly, you\u2019ve known him through many personally stressful times in his life and those never stopped him from wanting to get it on.", "link":

ticking it off the bucket list", "author": [], "text": "Tucked over 500 kilometers and between 10 to 15 hours way from Uganda\u2019s capital Kampala, is Bwindi impenetrable forest which also is home to Bwindi National Park.\n\nThe month of March happened to be a special month for me as I was among members of the Conservation Media Camp selected for a trip to Kanungu district for the opening of a new heritage centre for the Batwa community by Change A Life Bwindi, a Non -Government Organization.\n\nThis was before Coronavirus and the resultant announcement of the lockdown in Uganda disrupted the way of life.\n\nAfter a 14-hour drive, we arrived at Kitahurira village, Mpungu sub-county in Kanungu district, the home to Ihamba residence which would be our home for the next three nights.\n\nIhamba is a Rukiga word to mean a forest and as such, the serene lodge and home away from home is a few metres adjacent to the Bwindi Impenetrable forest.\n\nIt is therefore, not by coincidence that the large primeval forest located in South western- Uganda shares its cool weather with Ihamba residence.\n\nOn our last day in Kanungu, we were swayed by Christine Katushabe, the proprietor of Change A Life Bwindi not to leave without paying a visit to the impenetrable forest.\n\nBy the look of things, it was just a walkover to go through the forest but as they say; never judge a book by its cover.\n\nAt around 10am, the journey started but a few falls were almost inevitable because Ihamba is on a raised ground and we had to slope deep the valley to the forest.\n\nBefore, we left for the journey, our guide and Uganda Wildlife Authority ranger, Abel Tarinyebwa warned us that one of the most important tools that we needed was a panga but many laughed it off, but in order not to demoralize him, we carried one.\n\nWith the forest in sight, the journey continued and it took us not more than 15 minutes before what had been intimated to us as a no mean fete came to pass.\n\nThere was no path and the only way out was to use our pangas to cut through the thick grass and small trees to force our way into the forest.\n\nThose with short sleeved shirts and shorts will always have a story to tell after thickets and thorns did a good job on their bodies.\n\nOver 500 metres into the forest, we could hear the magnificent sound of one of the many falls making up the impenetrable forest and by the look of things, it was a few metres away but we had to walk for over 30 minutes to find it.\n\nThe journey saw us cross a makeshift wooden bridge to the other side of the stream.\n\nOn many occasions, according to our guide, tourists get lost yet the only way to cross the stream is through the makeshift bridge but the trick is finding the stream and following it until one finds the bridge.\n\nOur walk was punctuated by a number of stopovers to rest and re-energize before embarking on the next part of the journey.\n\nDuring the stopovers and throughout the journey, we chatted about different stories we could come across as a way of keeping ourselves busy through the walk but on many occasions, horrific stories were told leaving listeners quiet out of fear.\n\nThe beautiful scenery and euphonious sounds of birds in the forest were another beauty that could never go unappreciated but a number of falls along the slippery path were almost inevitable.\n\nWe however were not able to catch a glimpse of some of the mammals in the forest because we had not heeded to an earlier call by the UWA ranger to keep quiet while in the forest that also serves as a national park.\n\nWhat we thought could be a few hours of simple nature walk turned out to be an 8-hour journey through the impenetrable forest that saw us arrive at Ihamba at a few minutes to 6pm in the evening.\n\nDespite being knackered, boots covered in mad, trousers wet and dirty and our bodies itching, courtesy of thickets, there was silent but evident satisfaction on our faces that beamed as we arrived at our starting point, Ihamba residence.\n\nWe had been able to dare and penetrate the Bwindi Impenetrable forest but one could easily say that nothing is given when it comes to the no mean fete we had achieved.\n\nI had also ticked Bwindi off my bucket list.\n\nBefore trekking\n\nYou need to check your fitness levels as you bless for over 6 hours of trek through the thick forest.\n\nGumboots or strong jungle shoes and a raincoat are a must, for there are a number of items that might hit your feet but also being a tropical rainforest, expect it to rain any time.\n\nLong sleeved attire and a bottle of water are also a must as you brace for the long journey through the thorny forest of Bwindi.\n\nRates\n\nIhamba residence\u2019s accommodation is around $85 for a Ugandan and $100 for non -Ugandans for a night whereas the forest nature walk is shs30,000.", "link":

Fast forward, around March, a month after POATE, Covid-19 spread across the world. Overnight, the tourism sector and economies across the world came to a halt.\n\nA number of discussions on how the sector will bounce back have been initiated at policy level through our Ministry, at Uganda Tourism Board, private sector and global organisations such as the United Nations World Travel Organisation; with whom we are working closely.\n\nGlobally, the tourism industry is among those industries that are being keenly looked at on how it will navigate through the Covid-19 pandemic. How well the sector bounces back means a lot to economies and individual livelihoods.\n\nIn the case of Uganda, tourism contributed 7.7% to the GDP in FY2018/2019 and has been the topmost forex earner for the last 5 years. The sector also contributes a total of over 670, 000 jobs to the economy, in addition to collectively protecting and conserving the country\u2019s rich and natural resources.\n\nWhile the discussions around post-Covid-19 recovery continues, there is a need to talk about what we shall be doing once we are back to the \u2018new normal\u201d. The disruption cannot allow us to go back to business as usual mode. His Excellency, the President, Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has guided that a lot will need to change in the country and that the disruption caused by COvid-19 presents an opportunity for import substitution.\n\nEven for the tourism sector, there is a need to further refocus our business strategies, with a major focus on revitalizing domestic tourism as the global tourism industry recovers. More specifically, we shall need to look at product diversification, identifying new markets, bridging the skill gap, and marketing destination Uganda more than ever. Whatever we choose to do next should benefit a lot from the lessons this crisis has taught us \u2013 adaptation.\n\nTourism as a sector moving forward must look at inclusive growth; for example in the case of domestic tourism ensure that locals play key roles and benefit a lot from tourism activities in their community. Let\u2019s also not forget that consumer confidence has been greatly impacted by the pandemic which means going forward people will be more aware and cautious about where they choose to travel to. For the sector, it\u2019s time to prepare for a different type of consumer and be ready to meet the challenges they come with- the biggest challenge being regaining their confidence. We thank the president and the Ministry of Health for the national communication on the COVID-19 pandemic and its management as this plays a key role in traveler confidence going forward.\n\nNo one should expect the growth in numbers to happen instantaneously. It\u2019s going to take concerted and deliberate effort to ensure domestic tourism numbers grow post- Covid-19 lockdown and the subsequent end of the pandemic. This is of course with the interventions mentioned earlier. Partnerships and collaborations across the public and private sectors will play a big role when it comes to supporting the post-recovery phase. Competition is healthy but if an opportunity for collaboration presents itself, we must grab it.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the challenges the industry faces now, it\u2019s upon the players and stakeholders in the sector to keep reminding themselves of what the tourism sector is and has been for many years. This is a time to rise and be at the forefront of any efforts that will be put in place to ensure it recovers. Tourism needs us and we must show up. If we can\u2019t do tourism for now, then let\u2019s at least talk about tourism.", "link": "https://nilepost.co.ug/2020/05/05/if-we-cant-do-tourism-for-now-lets-talk-tourism/", "published": "2020-05-05T00:00:00"}]}, "UGANDA RADIO NETWORK": {"link": "http://ugandaradionetwork.com/", "articles": []}, "THE INDEPENDENT": {"link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/", "articles": [{"title": "Lives saved or deaths postponed? Calculating the cost of lockdowns", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "Paris, France | AFP | While lockdowns undoubtedly avoided large numbers of deaths from the new coronavirus, the repercussions of the pandemic response are expected to blight economies and health systems long after restrictions are lifted.\n\nSo how can we quantify the costs and benefits of one of the largest public health interventions ever?\n\n\u201cThis is a very difficult calculation to make,\u201d Sarah Burgard, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, told AFP.\n\nAccording to official counts, the virus has infected at least 7.4 million people around the world and more than 415,000 have died.\n\nBurgard said in the end it may prove difficult to untangle how many deaths were caused by COVID-19 and how many by \u201cthe chaos and fallout\u201d of the crisis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of faith that we are going to be able to come up with a very clear number,\u201d she said.\n\nEven if a figure is reached, decisions over its implications would be \u201cheavily political and ethically complex\u201d.\n\nThe response to the disease had led to an unprecedented reorganisation of societies, with businesses shuttered, stay-at-home orders, medical facilities refocused on treating COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe economic impact of the measures has caused alarm and division.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Unknown situation\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn a study published in 2000, the American economist Christopher Ruhm asked a provocative question: \u201cAre recessions good for your health?\u201d\n\nHis research found that a rise in unemployment sharpened stresses on mental health, causing increases in substance abuse and suicide.\n\nBut there were unexpected benefits for physical health: road accidents and pollution reduced, while people had more time for exercise.\n\nReflecting on his work two decades later, Ruhm said that in a normal economic slump \u201cwhen unemployment was high, mortality was low and vice versa\u201d.\n\nBut the coronavirus-induced recession is not a normal economic downturn.\n\n\u201cWe are in an unknown situation,\u201d Ruhm said in an April online talk for the University of Virginia, where he is a professor of public policy and economics.\n\n\u201cI think it may be the first time in history that we are actually deliberately creating a recession, not because we want to create a recession, but because this health threat is so real.\u201d\n\n\u2013 No silver linings \u2013\n\nNow societies are bearing the strain of both a deadly pandemic and a huge economic shock.\n\nThe virus undercuts the usual \u201csilver linings\u201d of an economic downturn, said Burgard.\n\nPopulations have been confined inside, reducing access to beneficial physical exercise.\n\nPeople struggling with bereavement, mental health issues or unemployment find it harder to access their normal support networks, with even visits to family members restricted.\n\nAnd the healthcare sector itself has been battered by the virus, with frontline staff at risk of infection while treatments for other illnesses have been postponed.\n\nEven in normal times, any positive effects seen in economic downturns are often in richer nations.\n\n\u201cThe opposite seems true in many low- and middle-income countries, where mortality actually increases during recession,\u201d said Thomas Hone, a public health researcher at Imperial College London.\n\nHe said this may suggest that what protects people from the harms of recessions are \u201cstrong health systems and social security nets\u201d.\n\nMany fear the scale of the pandemic and economic downturn will disproportionately hurt the most vulnerable.\n\nUN agencies and the vaccine alliance Gavi have said virus restrictions caused immunisations to be disrupted in nearly 70 countries, affecting some 80 million children under the age of one and threatening a resurgence of preventable diseases like polio and measles.\n\nThe World Food Programme estimates the number of people facing acute hunger this year could nearly double \u2014 to 265 million.\n\n\u2013 \u2018No choice\u2019 \u2013\n\nWill the long-term ramifications of lockdowns counteract the effect they had on slowing contagion?\n\nIn a study published on Monday, Imperial College researchers estimated that lockdowns had prevented around 3.1 million deaths in 11 European countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Imperial epidemiologist Neil Ferguson told a British parliamentary committee that because of the exponential spread of the virus, locking down just a week earlier would have reduced the final death toll by \u201cat least a half\u201d.\n\nBut any modelling is based on assumptions \u2014 in this case calculations of what would have happened if action had not been taken.\n\nRestrictions were imposed after predictions of potentially enormous tolls, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think politicians and leaders had a choice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you saw those numbers in the millions of deaths, you had to take steps because you would have had a broken health system, a public that wouldn\u2019t have come out anyway because they would have been terrified.\u201d\n\nCaplan said there should be a \u201cbroad set of voices\u201d in determining whether the lockdowns were the right solution, but added that the question would be \u201cpolitical\u201d.\n\nAnd will the people whose lives are affected in the future be counted in this reckoning?\n\nSome think not.\n\n\u201cWe will not have the director general of health reeling off the statistics of excess mortality by suicide or stroke every evening,\u201d French sociologist Didier Fassin said in the newspaper Le Monde.", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/lives-saved-or-deaths-postponed-calculating-the-cost-of-lockdowns/", "published": "2020-06-13T08:00:12+03:00"}, {"title": "ICC must up its

Criminal Court must step up to ensure its survival after US President Donald Trump authorised sanctions against the tribunal over an Afghan war crimes probe, experts said Friday.\n\nTrump\u2019s adminstration on Thursday unleashed an unprecedented onslaught against what it branded a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, subjecting ICC officials to asset freezes and travel bans if they target US personnel.\n\nThe move escalates long-standing US opposition to The Hague-based court, which is battling its own poor track record of convictions, lack of support from the world\u2019s largest powers

It is thus important that other states speak up clearly to support the independence of the court,\u201d Stahn told AFP.\n\nRights groups too have called on the ICC\u2019s 123 member states to reaffirm its support for the tribunal, a court of last resort for war crimes and crimes against humanity if countries were unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is now upon ICC member states to translate their statements of support into action,\u201d said Amal Nassar, the International Federation for Human Rights\u2019 representative at the ICC.\n\n\u201cThis includes full cooperation with the court in its investigations, adequate resources, and a clear signal that ICC staff, their families, human rights defenders and legal professionals can count on their support and protection,\u201d Nassar said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Wave of solidarity\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut the virulent US opposition against the ICC might have a counter-productive effect, Stahn said.\n\n\u201cCuriously, the US political attacks may backfire in the sense that they may create a new wave of solidarity at a time where the ICC is undergoing internal reform efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nIts governing body, the Assembly of States Parties, in particular \u201cis now asked more than ever to reaffirm the core principles of the ICC,\u201d said Stahn.\n\nStahn however said he did not believe the sanctions would threaten the court\u2019s existence.\n\nThe ICC has started a new set of prosecutions which included the surrender of Ali Kushayb, a Janjaweed militiaman accused of war crimes committed in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region in 2003-2004.\n\n\u201cIn some situations, ICC investigations may also serve US interests,\u201d he said.", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/icc-must-up-its-game-to-survive-after-us-onslaught-experts/", "published": "2020-06-13T07:30:20+03:00"}, {"title": "All set for Ndayishimiye to take charge in Burundi", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "All set for Ndayishimiye to take charge in Burundi\n\nBurundi court orders president-elect sworn in after leader\u2019s death\n\nBujumbura, , Burundi | AFP | Burundi\u2019s constitutional court on Friday ruled that the country\u2019s newly elected leader Evariste Ndayishimiye be rapidly sworn in following the sudden death of President Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this week.\n\nNkurunziza\u2019s death on Monday, aged 55, came after the May election of his successor Ndayishimiye, who was meant to be inaugurated in August.\n\nThe unusual situation raised questions over how the transition would be managed, as the constitution calls for the speaker of the national assembly to step in if the president dies.\n\nHowever in its judgement the court wrote that an interim period \u201cis not necessary\u201d.\n\nThe court ruled that the country must \u201cproceed, as soon as possible, with the swearing-in of the president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye\u201d.\n\nNkurunziza, a devout evangelical who believed he was chosen by God to lead Burundi, leaves behind a deeply isolated country in political and economic turmoil after his divisive 15-year rule.\n\nHis 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 dead while some 400,000 fled the country.\n\nA climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media settled over Burundi, while a personality cult grew around Nkurunziza which saw the ruling party name him a \u201cvisionary\u201d and \u201csupreme guide for patriotism.\u201d\n\nUnited Nations human rights investigators have said the period since 2015 has been marked by likely crimes against humanity committed by state forces, citing extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture and sexual violence.\n\nNkurunziza\u2019s decision not to run in the May 20 election shocked many, as it came after the constitution was changed to allow him to do so.\n\n\u2013 Handpicked successor \u2013\n\nHis successor Ndayishimiye, 52, was handpicked by the ruling party\u2019s core group of powerful generals, and won the election with 68.7 percent.

My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of military involvement in domestic politics,\u201d General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said of the controversial June 1 incident.\n\nMilley\u2019s comments appeared likely to further strain the already fraught relations between US military leaders and the White House.\n\nThey came two days before Trump will appear in person at the graduation ceremony of the elite US Military Academy at West Point.\n\nThe ceremony is being held despite the coronavirus pandemic at Trump\u2019s own wish, and he often uses such events to lay claim to his bonds with the military and assert his role as commander-in-chief.\n\nBut relations have frayed over Trump\u2019s move to involve the Pentagon in efforts to quell protests and some looting around the country following the killing of African-American George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer.\n\n\u2013 Battle uniform \u2013\n\nMilley and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper were both strongly criticized for participating in what was widely seen as a political show by Trump, who walked with officials from the White House to pose in front of St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, holding up a Bible.\n\nMinutes earlier, hundreds of peaceful protestors had been forced from Lafayette Park between the White House and the church by police and National Guard troops firing smoke bombs and tear gas-like pepper rounds.\n\nMilley\u2019s presence was particularly criticized as he was wearing his camouflage battle uniform.\n\nNormally military officials wear their formal dress uniform when holding meetings in the White House, and for many it implied Milley\u2019s support for Trump\u2019s stated desire to deploy active duty US troops against protesters.\n\nIn a pre-recorded video message, Milley told new graduates of the National Defense University that pictures of him and Esper walking with Trump \u201csparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society.\u201d\n\nTrump had summoned Milley and Esper to the White House to discuss the extraordinary measure of using active military troops in addition to National Guards to confront protestors.\n\nPentagon officials have said both had little time to prepare for the meeting, which caught Milley in his battle uniform and Esper as they were headed to a separate non-public meeting.\n\nNor did they know ahead of time that National Guard troops were going to clear the park using chemical munitions to force the protestors out, Pentagon officials said.\n\nSeveral former holders of Milley\u2019s position blasted him and Esper for accompanying Trump and allowing the military to be politicized.\n\n\u201cI am deeply worried that as they execute their orders, the members of our military will be co-opted for political purposes,\u201d said former Joint Chiefs chairman admiral Mike Mullen.\n\n\u2013 Freedom to protest \u2013\n\nTwo days later Esper announced that he would not support Trump\u2019s desire to invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to call up active troops to deal with the protests.\n\nThat, according to media reports, infuriated Trump, who had to be convinced by White House advisors and senior lawmakers not to fire Esper.\n\nIn his speech Thursday, Milley stressed that US citizens have the constitutional right to protest peacefully.\n\n\u201cWe should all be proud that the vast majority of protests have been peaceful. Peaceful protests mean that American freedom is working,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe in the military will continue to protect the rights and freedoms of all American people,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Total confidence \u2013\n\nTrump made no immediate comment on Milley\u2019s statement, but it sparked speculation the president could retaliate and fire him.\n\nSenior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, normally a firm supporter of Trump, said in a tweet that he had \u201ctotal confidence\u201d in Milley as Joint Chiefs chairman.\n\n\u201cI support his statement in both substance and spirit regarding the recent presidential visit to St. Johns.\u201d", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/top-us-general-says-wrong-to-appear-with-trump-at-protest-site/", "published": "2020-06-12T21:00:36+03:00"}, {"title": "UK PM defends history in statue row, as fears grow over protests", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "London, United Kingdom | AFP | Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday said a wave of anti-racism protests across Britain had been \u201chijacked by extremists\u201d, as fears mounted about clashes between activists and far-right groups.\n\nIn London, authorities boarded up several statues, including one of World War II leader Winston Churchill, after previous damage and with further demonstrations planned.\n\nMayor Sadiq Khan said the monuments, as well as the Cenotaph war memorial, were being protected against the risk of \u201cdisorder, vandalism and violence\u201d.\n\nStatues and monuments to figures involved in Britain\u2019s colonial past and the international slave trade have become increasing targets for activists over the last week.\n\nThat has prompted calls for a re-examination of how the country\u2019s historical legacy is marked in public spaces, and for many monuments to be torn down or relocated to museums.\n\nOn Sunday, crowds in Bristol, southwest England, toppled a statue to a 17th century slave trader and philanthropist, Edward Colston, and threw it into the harbour.\n\nBut while recognising the \u201clegitimate desire to protest against discrimination\u201d, Johnson said: \u201cWe cannot now try to edit or censor our past.\n\n\u201cWe cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThey had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults.\n\n\u201cTo tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.\u201d\n\nThe protests were sparked by the death during a US police arrest of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American, which have triggered outrage around the world.\n\nJohnson acknowledged the anger of black and minority ethnic communities and said there had been \u201chuge\u201d strides in tackling discrimination in Britain.\n\nBut after clashes marred largely peaceful demonstrations in London, he added: \u201cIt is clear that the protests have been sadly hijacked by extremists intent on violence.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on the police and indiscriminate acts of violence which we have witnessed over the last week are intolerable and they are abhorrent.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Tensions high \u2013\n\nWith tensions running high and police promising a \u201crobust\u201d response to violence, the Black Lives Matter group called off a demonstration planned for Saturday in London\u2019s Hyde Park.\n\nThat followed far-right groups saying they would stage a counter-demonstration.\n\n\u201cWe want the protests to be a safe space for people to attend however we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be possible with people like them present,\u201d BLM London said on Instagram.\n\nOn Friday it unveiled a billboard on the banks of the River Thames to more than 3,000 victims of what it called \u201cstate and racist violence\u201d.\n\nTheir names were contained in the letters of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, Floyd\u2019s last words before his death, as a white police officer held him down in a chokehold.\n\nMayor Khan backed protesters, saying Floyd\u2019s death \u201cmust be a catalyst for systemic, lasting change to tackle the racism and inequalities that black people still face today\u201d.\n\nBut both he and Johnson urged people to stay home this weekend, both because of the risk of spreading the coronavirus and of violence.\n\n\u201cExtreme far-right groups who advocate hatred and division are planning counter-protests, which means that the risk of disorder is high,\u201d the London mayor said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Absurd and shameful\u2019 \u2013\n\nChurchill\u2019s statue was vandalised last weekend by campaigners who say his \u201cracist\u201d policies led to the deaths of millions of people during famine in the Indian state of Bengal in 1943.\n\nJohnson, who has written a biography of the wartime leader, said it was \u201cabsurd and shameful\u201d his memorial would be targeted, as he fought against fascism and tyranny.\n\n\u201cYes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial,\u201d the premier wrote.\n\nActivists linked to the Stop Trump Coalition have compiled a crowd-sourced list of more than 60 statues and monuments across Britain that they say \u201ccelebrate slavery and

Kakande said that the government has cut billions off all ministries\u2019 travel budget both for inland and foreign trips.\n\nThis started early from April with most agencies having their travel budgets cut to \u2018zero\u2019. Kakande said this will continue with the new financial year. Travel for different officials takes more than 100 billion Shillings in a particular financial year.\n\nThe budget which is expected to be at least 45.5 trillion Shillings will look to address three things \u2013 support the recovery from the coronavirus crisis, disaster-prone areas and then bear in mind of the 2021 general election.\n\nFinance Minister Matia Kasaija will announce the biggest allocations to works and transport, security, interest payments, education and health in that order.\n\nWorks and Transport in particular will be allocated 5.8 trillion Shillings accounting for 12.5 percent of the budget. This is a slight drop from the 6.4 trillion Shillings the sector got in the 2019/20 financial year. Still it taking the biggest chunk is an indicator that the government hasn\u2019t moved away from its focus on roads despite having a health pandemic. Kakande said some of the projects have been committed and it\u2019s a legal obligation that the government continues paying them.\n\nSecurity will be allocated 4.5 trillion Shillings but much of this money is classified. Interest payments, the money government pays to lenders for lending their money will be 4 trillion Shillings up from 3 trillion Shillings last year while the Health sector will get 2.7 trillion Shillings a slight improvement from the 2.5 trillion in the 2019/20 budget.\n\nKasaija will also announce a wide range cut in taxes in the push to recover from the coronavirus crisis but also appear to appease the 2021 general election voters. These include most agriculture inputs, cooking gas and processed milk.\n\nAllan Mugisha, an auditor at Ernst and Young, said some of these cuts are good for the environment and boost the agriculture production. Of interest in the budget will be the source of funding. Kakande said domestic taxes and international taxes have been cut by the closure of businesses, borders and limited consumption.\n\nShe said they don\u2019t expect a lot of grants from donors as their own countries are also suffering from coronavirus impact.\n\nThe major source of funding will be borrowing, she said. According to figures presented by Ernst and Young, the government will borrow up to 11 trillion Shillings from external sources for the 2020/21 budget. It expects grants of 1.7 trillion Shillings.\n\nThe money will go to both budget and project support. The government hopes to raise 33 trillion Shillings from domestic sources.\n\n******\n\nURN", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/govt-to-cut-billions-off-travel-focus-on-agriculture-and-push-for-efficiency/", "published": "2020-06-11T07:30:35+03:00"}, {"title": "Do not blame me for any COVID-19 deaths \u2013 Museveni", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | President Yoweri Museveni has said that he has played his part in containing the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and can no longer take the blame if Ugandans start dying due to \u201ccarelessness\u201d.\n\nMuseveni said people have not died in Uganda because initially, his directives were followed to the letter which led to a few people being hospitalized. He however said with the ever-rising numbers which currently stand at 657, it might be very hard to stop deaths.\n\nHis caution comes amid an increased number of COVID-19 community cases reported by the Ministry of Health coupled with the laxity amongst the population, the majority of whom have ignored advice to maintain social distance, wear face masks or even stay at home. Despite the increase in cases, the city is crowded and the streets are filled up.\n\n\u201cThose who were healed were healed because the numbers in the treatment centres were few and the doctors could concentrate on them. I appeal to you Ugandans for those whose activities we have opened up, observe the social distance, I beg you for the sake of yourself. Keep the distance, put on the mask don\u2019t go in public without a mask.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mask is not very comfortable but medicine apart from that of children is bitter,\u201d Museveni said as he presided over the National Heroes Day celebrations at State House, Entebbe today.\n\nHe added that he is disturbed by images of Ugandans disregarding all the preventive measures against the coronavirus.\n\nMuseveni said although his ministry of health officials were planning for health facilities with 9000-bed capacity, he advised them to plan for 40,000-bed capacity and that places like Namboole stadium are being prepared to treat a big number of people if cases continue to rise. He warned, \u201cif the numbers are too big, then they will overwhelm even the big place we have prepared.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, we are confronted by an enemy worse than the war of bullets that we fought. It is a biological war and the value of discipline cannot be over-emphasised. Without a cure or vaccine for Covid-19, it is our personal discipline that matters most,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president added that Ugandan scientists are in advanced stages of looking for a coronavirus vaccine. He however cited corruption as the biggest impediment to the process. \u201cParasites go to hell; I\u2019m really tired of those people who don\u2019t care about the country but themselves,\u201d Museveni said.\n\nToday\u2019s heroes\u2019 day celebrations were supposed to be held in Lyantonde district however due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was shifted to State House. Esther Mbayo, the Minister for the Presidency said that even people who had been vetted to receive medals this year couldn\u2019t receive them because of the same issue.\n\n******\n\nURN", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/do-not-blame-me-for-any-covid-19-deaths-museveni-tells-ugandans/", "published": "2020-06-09T16:20:24+03:00"}, {"title": "State of the Nation address", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "Was Museveni right to skip politics, COVID-19, to tout economy?\n\n| MUBATSI ASINJA HABATI | When President Yoweri Museveni delivered the State of the Nation on June 4 he had a choice: to focus on politics as he has done in the past, dwell on the economy, or explain the next steps in the COVID-19 health scare which is the urgent issue in the country. He chose the economy.\n\nIt was a major diversion, even by the structure of his written speech which was built on the motif of the 10-point programme that Museveni and his then group of rebel fighters adopted in the early 1980s while fighting the jungles of Luweero, in central Uganda.\n\nBuilding an independent, integrated and self-sustaining national economy, which the President dwelt on in his speech, is point NO.5 on the 10-Point Programme. Point N0. 1 is restoration of democracy, point N0. 2 restoration of security, point N0. 3 consolidation of national unity and elimination of all forms of sectarianism, and point N0.4 is defending and consolidating national independence.\n\nSome of the points are superfluous and many are difficult for Museveni to lecture on convincingly. If he had chosen to dwell directly on the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the country, he would have been tackling point N0.6 on the 10-point programme; Restoration and improvement of social services and rehabilitation of war\u2013ravaged areas. He would have had to explain why health facilities remain under-staffed and under-stocked, even missing basic but vital items such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) for frontline medical workers.\n\nAs the President spoke, COVID-19 cases were rising rapidly towards the 1000 mark. It had started infecting medicals workers; seven in Gulu and one in Mulago. The Prime Minister, Ruhakana Rugunda who chairs the National COVID-19 Taskforce was in self-isolation over COVID-19 and there were reports that the main treatment centres at Mulago National Referral Hospital and Entebbe Grade B were getting overwhelmed with COVID-19 patient loads. They were turning away many of them.\n\nAlso, in her remarks just before the President delivered the address, Speaker of Parliament, Rebecca Kadaga, was more concerned with the political. She said the government needed to bring Bills related to the 2021 elections early for debate and not wait till just before election campaigns officially begin.\n\nBut President Museveni did not mention anything about the 2021 elections although there is growing concern.\n\nMuseveni is possibly contented at how his decrees to contain the Coronavirus pandemic have paralysed social gatherings, including political rallies, and given him the perfect pretext for postponing the 2021 election should he choose to. For now he has left everyone wondering if it will be possible to hold the general elections.\n\nThe public is also growing impatient about the national lockdown which was now in its third month. Some businesses, all schools, places of worship, and public transport remained paralysed. People needed answers. On March 18, Uganda launched a lockdown in response to the corona-virus pandemic.\n\nBullish economy\n\nThe President gave some hints in off the cuff remarks but his official speech was focused firmly on the economy. This is an area that is easy for Museveni to lecture on because he has a monopoly of the data; especially at the macro-economic level.\n\nAnd he was bullish. He said Uganda has not only successfully battled the COVID-19 pandemic, it has contended with floods, landslides, rising water-levels in the lakes, locust swarms, floating islands, security, crime, feeding millions of our people, etc.\n\nHe said he is confident that sectors like agriculture, which he said was the bedrock of Uganda\u2019s real economy, would cushion the economy from the shocks occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThat reflected the grandiose nature of his speech, where the more relevant aspects of the economy were speculative. Such as the banana flour project which this year consumed Shs9.5billion (bigger than the budgets of some ministries) and will next year swallow Shs12billion.", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/state-of-the-nation-address-2/", "published": "2020-06-08T09:00:05+03:00"}, {"title": "\u2018We want 2021 elections on time\u2019", "author": ["Isaac Khisa"], "text": "How People Power, JEEMA, FDC are uniting against Museveni\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT | ISAAC KHISA | The steps President Yoweri Museveni and his government have taken to contain the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic will make a big difference in the upcoming 2021 general elections. But to whose advantage?\n\nWatching these events, many political observers that spoke to The Independent say opposition politicians appear to have been pushed out of the spotlight by the ruling National Resistant Movement (NRM) candidates including President Museveni\n\nBut People Power Group leader and Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi aka Bobi Wine appears determined to reawaken the political contest. On June.02 he unveiled two teams that comprised an Electoral Management Committee and a Mobilisation Committee to oversee the election preparation affairs of the pressure group.\n\nThe leading opposition party, the Forum for democratic Change (FDC), is determined to the same, according to party spokesperson, Ibrahim Ssemujju Nganda who is the Kira Municipality MP.\n\nAt the moment, according to a roadmap by the national Electoral Commission, the political parties are supposed to be concluding their National Delegates\u2019 Conferences and electing their flag bearers ahead of parliamentary and presidential nominations that were slated for Aug.12 and Aug.20, 2020.\n\nAnd, although the Electoral Commission had announced that the presidential and parliamentary elections to be held anywhere between January 11 and February 9, 2021, the plan now hangs in balance due to the pandemic.\n\nBefore coronavirus was recorded in Uganda, prospective political contenders were in high gear galvanizing support in preparation for the presidential, parliamentary, and local government elections.\n\nBy early March this year, 24 presidential aspirants had already declared their intention to run for president and notified the Electoral Commission of their plan to start consultation.\n\nPresident Museveni, who has been in power for the last 34 years, had also shifted to 2021 election campaign gear.\n\nBut this came to an abrupt halt in March this year when the first coronavirus case was recorded in the country and subsequently the government instituted strict health and safety measures. The government banned gatherings of more than five people; including political ones, introduced social distancing, stay home directives, and national lockdowns to deal with the pandemic. Political party activity and formations that were conducting consultations in preparation for elections were stopped in their tracks.\n\nBut these COVID-19 containment measures also helped President Museveni to rebuild his election infrastructure, says Godber Tumushabe, a political commentator and Associate Director at the Great Lakes Institute for Strategic Studies.\n\nHe says combating COVID-19 has handed Museveni a free-hand to deploy the military, Local Defence Units (LDUs) and the Resident District Commissioners (RDCs) which have in the past elections been criticised for involvement in the elections.\n\nHe says also that due to COVID-19, all pieces of legislation relating to the upcoming general elections \u2013 which would potentially have contributed to creating a leveled ground for the political competitors \u2013 have not been presented to President Museveni for assent.\n\nThese proposed laws include; The Presidential Elections Amendment Bill 2019, Parliamentary Elections Amendment Bill 2019, Electoral Commission Amendment Bill, and the Political Parties and Organisations Amendment Bill 2019.\n\nTumushabe says President Museveni has also used the COVID-19 to invoke the spirit of militarism during his routine pandemic updates by constantly comparing it to his five-year rebel war in Luwero which he won to become president. Tumushabe says this is an early election campaign strategy when the country is fighting a different enemy.\n\n\u201c(The addresses) have been more campaigning than about the pandemic,\u201d Tumushabe said on one of the country\u2019s radio talk shows.\n\nHowever, other commenter\u2019s say there\u2019s was nothing that the government would have done in the pandemic fight, other than engaging in protecting the lives of the population.\n\nAs of June.04, the country has 507 C0VID-19 confirmed cases, with 82 recoveries and no death, according to the health ministry.\n\nThis development, however, comes even as President Yoweri Museveni repeatedly states that the decision to hold 2021 elections will depend on the advice of the scientists working to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nPresident Museveni, who delivered the message on the effects of COVID-19 to the Inter-party Organisation for Dialogue (IPOD) meeting where Justice Forum (Jeema) took over its leadership from the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) party recently, says major electoral activities have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the electoral calendar has been greatly disrupted. Museveni\u2019s message was delivered by the NRM Secretary General, Justine Lumumba.\n\n\u201cWe in NRM are political players. We cannot take a decision and say elections will be at this time without the advice of the scientists. All the presidential directives that have been given so far have been based on the advice of scientists,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEqually when it comes to elections, it will depend on the numbers of Covid-19 patients as the tests go on and also most importantly the advice of scientist,\u201d she added.\n\nFollowing Museveni\u2019s cue, the Electoral Commission Chairperson, Justice Simon Byabakama, now says the Commission is looking at all possible options available and at an appropriate time, will inform the nation its position with regard to the 2021 General Election.\n\nBut many political party leaders The Independent has spoken to say they are going ahead with preparations for the 2021 elections with or without Museveni and the Electoral Commission attempting to create uncertainty.", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/we-want-2021-elections-on-time/", "published": "2020-06-08T00:01:29+03:00"}, {"title": "All Ugandan Ministers to be tested for COVID-19", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | The Ministry of Health has confirmed that all ministers who attend cabinet meetings will undergo COVID-19 testing before they can attend the weekly sessions.\n\nThis development comes on a day where the Prime Minister Dr Ruhakana Rugunda decided to self isolate, after some of his recent contacts tested positive for the CoronaVirus.\n\nAccording to the health ministry, testing of the ministers begun yesterday and continued today at the office of the Prime Minister. On the first day of the exercise, a number of high profile officials reportedly tested positive for the virus and have started treatment. Their contacts, including the Prime Minister Dr Ruhakana Rugunda also went into self-isolation.\n\nDr Diana Atwine, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health says that the ministers are being tested because they are at high risk of contracting the disease since they come into close contact with many people.

The testing of high risk groups of people comes at a time when the number of confirmed cases in Uganda has risen to 557.\n\nUganda had suspended its high risk traveler testing because the health ministry says it was a waste of test kits.

The reality today, however, is that there are many businesses that did not have official remote work policies. The remote work happening is ad hoc and very informal. T\n\nhe mistake that organisations are making right now is to attempt to define the exact detail of what remote work policies should be. This is a little too late. Employees are already working remotely albeit in ad hoc ways. So the question managers should be asking is; now that we have employees who are working from home, how do we as employers make sure that they are not stuck up in the home environment? That productivity and employee retention is maintained to lead to success of the business?\n\nEmployers have to put a lot of focus on how to improve manager \u2013 employee interactions and communication in order to maintain productivity in a remote environment. In an informal remote workforce it turns out that employees begin to have a relationship of peer-to-peer rather than manager to employee.\n\nTherefore, employers need to think about how to make employee to employee relationships work in a way that peers can talk to each other, teams can work with each other and talk to each other and the workforce can still move in and across the organisation.\n\nOrganisations need to know that this is not a snow day where you know it will last for one or two days. Working remotely has dawned on us and is here to stay as the new normal. Therefore, leaders and managers should stop thinking about the processes and activities that remote employees get involved with; such as taking care of the children as they work, which would limit their ability to focus on work related matters. Rather managers should instead think about accomplishing expected outcomes. Are things getting done? Flexibility is at the heart of remote work. It is fine for\n\nemployers and managers to shift from managing processes to focusing on outcomes.\n\nLeaders should ensure that employees have the technology that they need to be successful. Technology is more than a laptop and a cellphone. These are necessary but not sufficient. Employers must make sure that the virtual private network VPN that some employees are using is capable of handling all that is required, along with providing employees great quality cameras to enable effective video conferencing. The internet access and Wi-Fi services at employees\u2019 remote locations should be robust enough to enable work to go on.\n\nThe employers need to ensure that the managers and employees know the right way to communicate in a virtual environment. For example: how do you communicate effectively in a virtual work place when you do not have body language to see what\u2019s going on? Leaders need to become intentional in making remote services work by enhancing communication procedures to coach managers and employees to work effectively in a remote environment.\n\nIn seasons of disruption like these due to the pandemic, remote service employees will require more tools and support in order to be most productive. The right thing for a manager to do is suspend disbelief and instead put utmost belief and trust in your employees. The managers can solve any puzzles later when the performance evaluation kicks in. During times of difficulty employees desire to be recognised for their contribution, therefore, as a manager you should identify what your employees are doing and their contribution and thank and reward them.\n\nIn conclusion, if the above issues can be addressed, then productivity and improved employee retention is likely to be maintained leading to the success of businesses. Leaders and employees should be ready to face the challenges that come with new ways of working but also learn fundamental lessons and skills in this season. At the end of the day, as a global work force, we are conducting a global pilot of remote work. It is the biggest pilot that has ever occurred on changing how people work and we should be able to cope.\n\n****\n\nDr. Caroline Sekiwano is Human Resource & Organisational Development Advisor\n\nCLICK TO READ ONLINE MAGAZINE HERE", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/manage-remote-employees-under-covid-19/", "published": "2020-06-10T09:10:52+03:00"}, {"title": "Global eSport industry eyes African market", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "eSports \u2013 competitive video gaming tournaments \u2013 are enjoying unprecedented growth under lockdown and South Africa could be a staging post for their expansion across the continent. Will McBain reports\n\n| THE INDEPENDENT | Johannesburg resident Sam \u201cTech Girl\u201d Wright kept her passion for video gaming a secret in high school. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t cool, you\u2019d just get mocked, and being a girl playing video games was even worse,\u201d she says.\n\nWright now travels the world hosting and commentating on eSports events \u2013 organised, often broadcasted, and sometimes lucrative video game competitions \u2013 and blogs about her local scene.\n\nThe South African market is part of a global eSports industry which was receiving increased attention from broadcasters, sponsors and advertisers even before the global coronavirus pandemic forced billions of house-bound citizens to seek new forms of entertainment.\n\nTwitch, a live video streaming service owned by Amazon which is frequented by gamers, has increased its users by over 25% since March, while eSports leagues catering to football, war game and fantasy players enjoy unprecedented growth. Footballers, Formula One drivers and entertainers including Trevor Noah compete in broadcasted eSports games during the pandemic, helping fill the void left by the absence of traditional sports and giving multiplayer online video games new global exposure.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing, everyone\u2019s the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re disabled, or what colour your skin is, it doesn\u2019t matter what gender you are. When you\u2019re in that game, you\u2019re on an equal playing field. And I think that\u2019s what makes it really fun, especially at this time,\u201d says Wright.\n\nRapidly growing market\n\nThe global eSports market is expanding rapidly. NewZoo, a market intelligence firm, predicts global revenues will grow to $1.1bn this year, with total audiences increasing to 495m, a year-on-year growth of 11.7%. Streaming revenue was forecast to hit $18.2m globally, up 33% from 2019, but could now be significantly higher given the pandemic.\n\nGrowth worldwide is underpinned by the vast, tech-savvy markets of China and India. But Africa\u2019s growing young population and uptake of internet and smartphone technology has led some industry players to cast their eye towards the continent. Futuresource estimates annual audience size in the region will grow from 30m in 2020 to 53m by 2023.\n\n\u201cWith a youthful and increasingly urban population in Africa, there\u2019s an opportunity to invest in the dynamic eSports ecosystem, and capitalise on a growing entertainment phenomenon within this emerging market,\u201d says Morris Garrard, an analyst at Futuresource Consulting.\n\n\u201cAs the audience grows, more businesses are expected to invest in African team talent, with South African and Egyptian gamers already starting to feature on international rosters. This opens up sponsorship opportunities for companies investing in these athletes, with advertising targeted to better reach African fans\u201d.\n\nGateway to Africa\n\nIn March, Nodwin Gaming, an Indian licensor and creator of eSports properties that provides media rights for live events and programming and claims to have engaged over 20m gamers, announced its expansion into South Africa with the opening of a new office. The firm has also invested in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\n\u201cWith South Africa, we are pushing our geographical limits. The expansion is a gateway to not just South Africa but the whole of Africa. Regarding the development of eSports in the region, the scenario right now looks a lot similar to what India was five years ago. The South African audience is a healthy mix of PC and console players alongside the massive mobile gaming populace,\u201d said Sidharth Kedia, Group CEO of Nodwin Gaming, in a press release at the beginning of March.\n\nMerlin Wiedeking, CEO at Nodwin Gaming International, expects further interest in South Africa as broadband proliferates and data costs come down. The company targets the key 16-30 age group, which appeals to advertisers.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s such a large continent with so many people, and so many opportunities,\u201d says Wiedeking. \u201cSure there\u2019s economic challenges, but we could never understand why nobody\u2019s trying to come in and do something with the industry, but that\u2019s now what we\u2019re trying to do\u201d.\n\nCompetitive disadvantage\n\nTournaments are streamed on Facebook, Twitch and YouTube, or sold as media rights to traditional broadcasters, with sponsorship from large multinationals like Coca-Cola and RedBull. Ginx Esports TV, an international, multi-language TV channel, features on the sub-Saharan satellite platform DStv.\n\nThe direction of travel is encouraging for the industry, but rights packages remain small compared to traditional sports. Those grinding away behind the scenes caution that revenue streams are in their infancy.\n\nFurthermore, slow broadband speeds, the high cost of data and the relatively expensive cost of consoles and games stand as significant barriers to growth on the continent, particularly outside South Africa. The speed between a player\u2019s computer or mobile device and the game server can prove crucial in tight contests, hampering the ability of African gamers to compete on a level playing field with international rivals.\n\nThis competitive disadvantage forces African gaming talent like South Africa\u2019s Bravado Gaming team to travel abroad for competitions and qualification tournaments. The team, which competes in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive competitions, has moved from 188th to 18th in the world rankings.\n\nThe industry is beginning to offer solutions to address the problem. Last year, video games publisher Ubisoft, maker of Rainbow Six Siege, brought servers online in South Africa, allowing local gamers to compete on a more even footing against players in Tokyo, London and New York.\n\nWith the South African video games market expected to grow to R5.44bn ($292m) in 2023, according to Statista, a deep reservoir of eSport players and fans is being cultivated in the country.

Otherwise, some recovery is expected beginning next month once the budget is read.\u201d\n\nLast year, the insurance industry recorded Shs 284.12bn for the first quarter the year ending March.\n\nInitially, industry officials had anticipated to record at least 10% growth in gross underwritten premiums in 2020.\n\nHowever, all is not lost. The industry executives say there are signs of successful containment of effects of COVID-19 as people slowly return to work, and that once the discussions on the stimulus package are actualized, they expect the economy to recover, and insurance to pick up.\n\nThey are also hoping that COVID-19 is likely to improve risk awareness amongst the population as it has demonstrated how devastating an unplanned risks can be.\n\nAnd, that the compulsory uptake of marine insurance from local players effective next month via an online platform that has been developed is expected to generate significant premiums.\n\n****\n\nCLICK TO READ ONLINE MAGAZINE HERE", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/insurance-industry-records-8-drop-in-profit-to-shs17-93bn/", "published": "2020-06-09T08:00:40+03:00"}, {"title": "All set for Ndayishimiye to take charge in Burundi", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "All set for Ndayishimiye to take charge in Burundi\n\nBurundi court orders president-elect sworn in after leader\u2019s death\n\nBujumbura, , Burundi | AFP | Burundi\u2019s constitutional court on Friday ruled that the country\u2019s newly elected leader Evariste Ndayishimiye be rapidly sworn in following the sudden death of President Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this week.\n\nNkurunziza\u2019s death on Monday, aged 55, came after the May election of his successor Ndayishimiye, who was meant to be inaugurated in August.\n\nThe unusual situation raised questions over how the transition would be managed, as the constitution calls for the speaker of the national assembly to step in if the president dies.\n\nHowever in its judgement the court wrote that an interim period \u201cis not necessary\u201d.\n\nThe court ruled that the country must \u201cproceed, as soon as possible, with the swearing-in of the president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye\u201d.\n\nNkurunziza, a devout evangelical who believed he was chosen by God to lead Burundi, leaves behind a deeply isolated country in political and economic turmoil after his divisive 15-year rule.\n\nHis 2015 run for a third term in office sparked protests and a failed coup, with violence leaving at least 1,200 dead while some 400,000 fled the country.\n\nA climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media settled over Burundi, while a personality cult grew around Nkurunziza which saw the ruling party name him a \u201cvisionary\u201d and \u201csupreme guide for patriotism.\u201d\n\nUnited Nations human rights investigators have said the period since 2015 has been marked by likely crimes against humanity committed by state forces, citing extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture and sexual violence.\n\nNkurunziza\u2019s decision not to run in the May 20 election shocked many, as it came after the constitution was changed to allow him to do so.\n\n\u2013 Handpicked successor \u2013\n\nHis successor Ndayishimiye, 52, was handpicked by the ruling party\u2019s core group of powerful generals, and won the election with 68.7 percent.

Calculating the cost of lockdowns", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "Paris, France | AFP | While lockdowns undoubtedly avoided large numbers of deaths from the new coronavirus, the repercussions of the pandemic response are expected to blight economies and health systems long after restrictions are lifted.\n\nSo how can we quantify the costs and benefits of one of the largest public health interventions ever?\n\n\u201cThis is a very difficult calculation to make,\u201d Sarah Burgard, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, told AFP.\n\nAccording to official counts, the virus has infected at least 7.4 million people around the world and more than 415,000 have died.\n\nBurgard said in the end it may prove difficult to untangle how many deaths were caused by COVID-19 and how many by \u201cthe chaos and fallout\u201d of the crisis.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of faith that we are going to be able to come up with a very clear number,\u201d she said.\n\nEven if a figure is reached, decisions over its implications would be \u201cheavily political and ethically complex\u201d.\n\nThe response to the disease had led to an unprecedented reorganisation of societies, with businesses shuttered, stay-at-home orders, medical facilities refocused on treating COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe economic impact of the measures has caused alarm and division.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Unknown situation\u2019 \u2013\n\nIn a study published in 2000, the American economist Christopher Ruhm asked a provocative question: \u201cAre recessions good for your health?\u201d\n\nHis research found that a rise in unemployment sharpened stresses on mental health, causing increases in substance abuse and suicide.\n\nBut there were unexpected benefits for physical health: road accidents and pollution reduced, while people had more time for exercise.\n\nReflecting on his work two decades later, Ruhm said that in a normal economic slump \u201cwhen unemployment was high, mortality was low and vice versa\u201d.\n\nBut the coronavirus-induced recession is not a normal economic downturn.\n\n\u201cWe are in an unknown situation,\u201d Ruhm said in an April online talk for the University of Virginia, where he is a professor of public policy and economics.\n\n\u201cI think it may be the first time in history that we are actually deliberately creating a recession, not because we want to create a recession, but because this health threat is so real.\u201d\n\n\u2013 No silver linings \u2013\n\nNow societies are bearing the strain of both a deadly pandemic and a huge economic shock.\n\nThe virus undercuts the usual \u201csilver linings\u201d of an economic downturn, said Burgard.\n\nPopulations have been confined inside, reducing access to beneficial physical exercise.\n\nPeople struggling with bereavement, mental health issues or unemployment find it harder to access their normal support networks, with even visits to family members restricted.\n\nAnd the healthcare sector itself has been battered by the virus, with frontline staff at risk of infection while treatments for other illnesses have been postponed.\n\nEven in normal times, any positive effects seen in economic downturns are often in richer nations.\n\n\u201cThe opposite seems true in many low- and middle-income countries, where mortality actually increases during recession,\u201d said Thomas Hone, a public health researcher at Imperial College London.\n\nHe said this may suggest that what protects people from the harms of recessions are \u201cstrong health systems and social security nets\u201d.\n\nMany fear the scale of the pandemic and economic downturn will disproportionately hurt the most vulnerable.\n\nUN agencies and the vaccine alliance Gavi have said virus restrictions caused immunisations to be disrupted in nearly 70 countries, affecting some 80 million children under the age of one and threatening a resurgence of preventable diseases like polio and measles.\n\nThe World Food Programme estimates the number of people facing acute hunger this year could nearly double \u2014 to 265 million.\n\n\u2013 \u2018No choice\u2019 \u2013\n\nWill the long-term ramifications of lockdowns counteract the effect they had on slowing contagion?\n\nIn a study published on Monday, Imperial College researchers estimated that lockdowns had prevented around 3.1 million deaths in 11 European countries.\n\nOn Wednesday, Imperial epidemiologist Neil Ferguson told a British parliamentary committee that because of the exponential spread of the virus, locking down just a week earlier would have reduced the final death toll by \u201cat least a half\u201d.\n\nBut any modelling is based on assumptions \u2014 in this case calculations of what would have happened if action had not been taken.\n\nRestrictions were imposed after predictions of potentially enormous tolls, said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think politicians and leaders had a choice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you saw those numbers in the millions of deaths, you had to take steps because you would have had a broken health system, a public that wouldn\u2019t have come out anyway because they would have been terrified.\u201d\n\nCaplan said there should be a \u201cbroad set of voices\u201d in determining whether the lockdowns were the right solution, but added that the question would be \u201cpolitical\u201d.\n\nAnd will the people whose lives are affected in the future be counted in this reckoning?\n\nSome think not.\n\n\u201cWe will not have the director general of health reeling off the statistics of excess mortality by suicide or stroke every evening,\u201d French sociologist Didier Fassin said in the newspaper Le Monde.", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/lives-saved-or-deaths-postponed-calculating-the-cost-of-lockdowns/#respond", "published": "2020-06-13T08:00:12+03:00"}, {"title": "ICC must

International Criminal Court must step up to ensure its survival after US President Donald Trump authorised sanctions against the tribunal over an Afghan war crimes probe, experts said Friday.\n\nTrump\u2019s adminstration on Thursday unleashed an unprecedented onslaught against what it branded a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d, subjecting ICC officials to asset freezes and travel bans if they target US personnel.\n\nThe move escalates long-standing US opposition to The Hague-based court, which is battling its own poor track record of convictions, lack of support from the world\u2019s largest powers and internal disputes over pay.\n\nBut analysts and rights groups urged the under-fire ICC \u2014 set up in 2002 to prosecute the world\u2019s worst crimes \u2014 to continue its work with renewed vigour if it wants to cement its legitimacy.\n\n\u201cI believe that the future of the court depends on its willingness to prosecute the \u2018hard cases\u2019 involving

It is thus important that other states speak up clearly to support the independence of the court,\u201d Stahn told AFP.\n\nRights groups too have called on the ICC\u2019s 123 member states to reaffirm its support for the tribunal, a court of last resort for war crimes and crimes against humanity if countries were unwilling or unable to prosecute suspects themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is now upon ICC member states to translate their statements of support into action,\u201d said Amal Nassar, the International Federation for Human Rights\u2019 representative at the ICC.\n\n\u201cThis includes full cooperation with the court in its investigations, adequate resources, and a clear signal that ICC staff, their families, human rights defenders and legal professionals can count on their support and protection,\u201d Nassar said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Wave of solidarity\u2019 \u2013\n\nBut the virulent US opposition against the ICC might have a counter-productive effect, Stahn said.\n\n\u201cCuriously, the US political attacks may backfire in the sense that they may create a new wave of solidarity at a time where the ICC is undergoing internal reform efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nIts governing body, the Assembly of States Parties, in particular \u201cis now asked more than ever to reaffirm the core principles of the ICC,\u201d said Stahn.\n\nStahn however said he did not believe the sanctions would threaten the court\u2019s existence.\n\nThe ICC has started a new set of prosecutions which included the surrender of Ali Kushayb, a Janjaweed militiaman accused of war crimes committed in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region in 2003-2004.\n\n\u201cIn some situations, ICC investigations may also serve US interests,\u201d he said.", "link":

Ajarova says the Association of Tour Operators are poised to lose 170 billion Shillings for this year with over 19,000 trips cancelled and lost.\n\nMPs have called on UTB to brand and market Ugandan food and culture, birds and animals.\n\nREAD LATEST UGANDA UPDATES ON COVID-19 HERE (click)\n\n******\n\nURN", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/utb-to-market-uganda-as-safest-destination-after-covid-19/#respond", "published": "2020-05-27T17:30:49+03:00"}, {"title": "International tourism to plunge up to 80% due to virus: UN", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "International tourism to plunge up to 80% due to virus: UN\n\nMadrid, Spain | AFP | The number of international tourist arrivals could plunge by 60 to 80 percent in 2020 owing to the coronavirus, the World Tourism Organization said Thursday, revising its previous forecast sharply lower.\n\nWidespread travel restrictions and the closure of airports and national borders to curb the spread of the virus had plunged international tourism into its worst crisis since records began in 1950, the UN body said in a statement.\n\nTourist arrivals fell by 22 percent in the first three months of the year, and by 57 percent in March alone, with Asia and Europe suffering the biggest declines, according to the Madrid-based organisation.\n\n\u201cThe world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis.

Dr Ambrose Musinguzi the UPDF Chief of Medical services said that the 86 UPDF medics had been trained early on before Uganda confirmed any case.\n\nDr John Lusiba, the UPDF Physician who headed the UPDF team at Mulago said the time spent at the hospital was a learning opportunity for them since they got to rub shoulders with all the big names in the country\u2019s health care.\n\n\u201c It has not only been an opportunity to serve, but also a time to share experiences and learn from the most senior specialists that Uganda has at Mulago and from Makerere University. We learnt but also built civil military relations which are a strong pillar of the institution of UPDF,\u201d said Dr Lusiba.\n\nThe UPDF medical team comprised of physicians, medical officers, Laboratory technicians, nurses and clinicians who the hospital says will be recalled in case need arises in the future.\n\n*****\n\nURN", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/updf-team-leaves-mulago-with-perfect-covid-19-record/#comments", "published": "2020-04-27T22:51:04+03:00"}, {"title": "VIDEO: When Dr Tedros warned that world is vulnerable to pandemics", "author": ["The Independent"], "text": "Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT & AFP | Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization who has been criticised by the US for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, warned for years that countries were not prepared in case one broke out.\n\nThe most shocking outbreak at the time he made his speech at the World Government Summit in Dubai in February 2018, was the spread of Ebola out of West Africa in 2014.\n\nThis, said Dr Tedros Adhanom, Director General of the World Health Organisation, exposed fault lines in global security by showing how a fragile health system can expose the world to the risk of catastrophe.\n\nTedros is renowned for his warmth and tendency to call everyone from colleagues to world leaders \u201cbrother\u201d or \u201csister\u201d, setting him apart from the famously cool persona of his predecessor, Margaret Chan of China.\n\nBut while he always seems to have a smile lurking under his trimmed moustache, Tedros has also revealed a fiery side.\n\nAfter a hefty barrage of criticism from Trump last week, Tedros warned that \u201cif you don\u2019t want many more body-bags then you refrain from politicising\u201d the pandemic.\n\nDuring that virtual briefing on April 8, Tedros also revealed that for months he had faced a virulent campaign of abuse against him, including racist comments and death threats.\n\nFULL SPEECH WORLD GOVERNMENT SUMMIT 2018\n\nCan we create a pandemic-free world?\n\nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\n\nDirector-General of the World Health Organization\n\nDubai\n\nExcellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\n\nThank you for the kind invitation to speak to you today, it\u2019s wonderful to be here with so many distinguished leaders from so many different spheres of life.\n\nI\u2019d like to especially thank the Government of the UAE for hosting this meeting, and for helping us to imagine the future.\n\nAs the previous speaker said, from predicting to shaping the future. This platform comes from visionary leadership, and what a great opportunity.\n\nI\u2019d like to begin with a story.\n\nIn a military camp, a cook reports to the medical centre with fever, a sore throat, and aches and pains.\n\nWithin minutes, a second soldier comes in with similar symptoms. By lunchtime there are more than 100 cases, and more than 500 by the end of the week.\n\nBatallions from the camp are sent to fight a war in foreign lands. Confined living quarters and massive movements of troops provide the ideal conditions for the virus to spread.\n\nWithin months, the epidemic sweeps across five continents.\n\nIts symptoms include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain. As the virus takes hold, patients turn blue and suffocate as their lungs fill with fluid.\n\nThere are no vaccines to stop the virus, and no drugs to treat it. Many of its victims are young, cut down in their most productive years.\n\nSchools, places of worship, theatres and other public places are closed. Business closing times are staggered to avoid congestion on public transport. Funerals are limited to 15 minutes, to minimise contact. There is a shortage of coffins.\n\nAnd then, as suddenly as it started, the pandemic ends.\n\nOne third of the world\u2019s population has been infected. Up to 100 million people are dead.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThis is not some future nightmare scenario. This is exactly what happened, 100 years ago during the Spanish flu epidemic, in 1918.\n\nSpanish flu remains the deadliest outbreak in recorded history, killing more people than the First World War itself.\n\nBut its lessons are just as relevant today as they were then: that a devastating epidemic can start in any country at any time, and kill millions of people, because we are not prepared, because we\u2019re still vulnerable.\n\nThankfully, we have not seen a public health emergency on that scale since then. But we may at any time. Outbreaks are a fact of life, and the world remains vulnerable.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s just a matter of luck. The H5N1 flu virus which appeared in 2003 is extremely dangerous, but has fortunately not become capable of spreading easily between humans.\n\nConversely, the H1N1 virus that sparked a global pandemic in 2009 was transmitted very easily between people, but was fortunately mild in most cases.\n\nThe most shocking outbreak of our time, of course, was the Ebola outbreak of 2014.\n\nAlthough it affected three poor West African countries, it exposed fault lines in global health security that put us all at risk.\n\nApart from its terrible human cost, Ebola also had a devastating economic impact. The IMF reduced its growth projections for the three affected countries. Commodity prices plunged, while unemployment and fiscal deficits rose.\n\nEbola showed just how the vulnerable the world is.\n\nSince taking office last year, I have made health emergencies \u2013 health security \u2014 a daily focus at the World Health Organization.\n\nI now receive a daily briefing note keeping me up to date on the state of all outbreaks and other health emergencies globally.\n\nWe operate a dashboard with near-real time data on all emergencies.\n\nAnd we have established the WHO Health Security Council, a fortnightly meeting co-chaired by me and by my Deputy Director-General for Health Emergencies, which does a deep dive into emergencies, to ensure we are not caught by surprise.\n\nEvery month, WHO screens around 5000 signals of new outbreaks across the world. We monitor these carefully because ignoring any one of them can be the difference between global spread of a deadly disease and rapid interruption of transmission.\n\nThere are signs that our new tighter focus is working.\n\nWhen we were notified last year of an outbreak of plague in Madagascar, rapid response by the government, supported by WHO and other partners, ensured that it was brought quickly under control and did not spread.\n\nLikewise, when the highly dangerous Marburg virus appeared in Uganda, last year, swift action ensured that it did not spill over into Kenya and beyond.\n\nEbola taught us several painful but valuable lessons. The most important is this: that a fragile health system in one country can potentially expose the world to a global health catastrophe.\n\nWhen surveillance systems are inadequate, or health workers do not show up to work because they have not been paid in months; or medicines are in short supply; or infection prevention and control is lacking, disaster is just around the corner.\n\nBut it is not enough just to respond to outbreaks. We must do our best to prevent them.\n\nTo do that, we must address the root cause of health insecurity: the lack of access of the most vulnerable people to essential health services.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s the absence of universal health coverage that is the greatest threat to health security.\n\nUniversal health coverage and health security are two sides of the same coin.\n\nBut the reality is that at least half the world\u2019s population lacks access to essential health services \u2013 3.5 billion people lack access to essential health services.\n\nAnd almost 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty every year because of the costs of paying for care out of their own pockets.\n\nWhen people cannot see a health worker close to their home, or cannot afford to use the services that are there, the earliest signals of an outbreak can be missed.\n\nBut when people can access quality services without being exposed to financial hardship, a devastating epidemic can be stopped before it starts.\n\nNew technologies, big data and e-health will play a vital part in improving surveillance and increasing access to services, but in many cases, the best defenses are surprisingly low-tech.\n\nEvidence and experience show that universal health coverage is within reach for all countries, at all income levels. Every nation can do more with the resources it has.\n\nIn Rwanda, for example, a Community-Based Health Insurance Scheme covers more than 80% of the population, in a country where 90% of people work in the informal sector.\n\nI visited a health centre in Rwanda recently where they told me that every single pregnant woman in that area gives birth at the health centre, and every single child is vaccinated. This is incredible, even in countries that are much richer than Rwanda.\n\nOr take China. In the past 20 years, China has made massive investments in its health infrastructure, making health services more equally accessible to its vast population. And rapid progress in Thailand too.\n\nThe result has been large declines in child and maternal mortality, improved health outcomes, and increased life expectancy.\n\nThe benefits of universal health coverage go far beyond health.\n\nJust as epidemics can cripple an economy, universal health coverage can help it grow. Strong, resilient health systems are integral to strong, resilient economies.\n\nWhen people are healthy, entire communities and nations thrive. When children live to adulthood, they become productive members of society. When women survive childbirth, they can return to working or caring for their families. When communities are free from pollution, harmful products and other causes of disease, they prosper.\n\nToo often, governments see the health sector as a cost to be contained, rather than an investment to be nurtured. But the return on investment in health is compelling: the world\u2019s top economists estimate that every single dollar spent on health returns up to US$20 in full-income growth within a generation.\n\nThe health sector is also a growing source of jobs. Among OECD countries, employment in the health and social sectors grew by 48% between 2000 and 2014, while jobs in industry and agriculture declined.\n\nAnd because 70% of the global health workforce is female, jobs for health workers are jobs for women.\n\nAll of this means that for most countries, the only real barrier is political will.\n\nUltimately, universal health coverage is a political choice.\n\nLast month I was in Kenya, where President Kenyatta has recently announced that affordable healthcare will be on the four pillars of the Kenyan economy for his second term in office.\n\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago, India announced a 12% increase in its health budget, which will benefit 500 million people and establish 150,000 health and wellness centres.\n\nThere is no single path to universal health coverage. Every country must find its own way, in the context of its own social, political and economic circumstances.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nWe do not know where or when the next global pandemic will occur, but we do know that it will take a terrible toll, both on human life, and on the global economy. It may even cause political instability.\n\nCan we create a pandemic-free world? This is the question. There is no such thing as a guarantee, but with meticulous preparation and rapid response, we can prevent most outbreaks from getting out of control, and limit the impact of those that spread internationally.\n\nBut this is not only a job for those of us in the health sector. Everyone has a role to play, from those who ensure the safety of our food, to those who strive for safety in our world. So, what can we do?\n\nThe key, as I said, is to acknowledge that universal health coverage and health security are two sides of the same coin, and to invest in strengthening the fabric of health systems everywhere. Strong health systems are our guarantee.\n\nThat\u2019s why WHO works all around the world to strengthen health systems, built on the foundation of people-centred primary health care that focuses on health promotion and disease prevention, with a strong focus on surveillance systems.\n\nBut I am also taking WHO beyond the technical to the political. We are now seeing unprecedented political momentum for universal health coverage.\n\nAt the World Health Assembly in May 2018, we will be issuing a challenge to all countries to take three concrete steps towards making universal health coverage a reality.\n\nEven the best health systems have room for improvement.\n\nSecond, we must prioritize the research and development of new vaccines and medicines. WHO\u2019s Research and Development Blueprint identifies the pathogens that are the most likely to spark an epidemic, and provides a guide for where investments are most urgently needed. Although this task is difficult, because we have millions of viruses that could potentially spark pandemics.\n\nThird, it is vital that we map global capacities for emergency preparedness and response. This is exactly what we have started to do, in partnership with the Wellcome Trust. Our aim is to establish a \u201chealth reserve army\u201d who can be deployed anywhere in the world within 72 hours to respond to outbreaks and other health emergencies. And we\u2019re building a strong partnership both on universal health coverage and health security with the World Bank.\n\nFinally, we need to sustainably finance the global health security system to prevent, detect and respond to threats. Governments must walk the talk to ensure a guaranteed level of contingency financing for health emergencies.\n\nDelivering on these priorities will cost money of course, but only a fraction of what remaining unprepared will cost. The estimate is by the way to prevent what happened with Ebola, not more than $2 million was required. But at the end of Ebola, the money that was spent was more than $2 billion.\n\nIn the end, prevention is not only better than cure; it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the basics and invest in prevention, prevention, prevention.\n\nI thank you.

MWENDA | This week, in his regular COVID19 briefings, President Yoweri Museveni claimed boda bodas are not an effective means of public transport! Who decides whether a particular mode of transport is effective: the president, a committee of experts or commuters i.e. the market? Ugandan commuters (the market) have consistently voted with their wallets for boda bodas as the most convenient and effective means of public transport!\n\nSecondly, the president also said that he was delaying allowing boda bodas back onto the roads because they are a health risk in this age of COVID. He then proceeded to open omnibuses and buses for public transport. Clearly, the president\u2019s advisors must have misled him. How can a bus or omnibus be safer than a boda boda taxi in terms of spreading an airborne disease? This is all strange.\n\nAn omnibus or bus is an enclosed space with limited circulation of air. Either of them, even under the new regulations of carrying half their usual passenger load, will carry 42 (for buses) and eight (for omnibuses) passengers each. Therefore in anyone trip the people exposed to the risk of contracting the virus are many. The boda boda, on the other hand, can be regulated to carry only one passenger at a time, thereby reducing the risk to only one person \u2013 the rider or the passenger.\n\nSecondly, because boda bodas are not enclosed, they ensure the best airflow, with wind literally reducing the risk of contamination. If properly regulated, with enforcement of strict rules for both rider and passenger to wear facemasks and sanitize, the risk of spreading the virus is significantly reduced compared to buses and omnibuses that the president has allowed. Therefore boda bodas are clearly the safest means of public transport to limit, even though not eliminate, the spread of COVID.\n\nOf course many people have raised substantial complaints about the safety of boda bodas. They congest the city (Kampala) and are responsible for a high number of motor accidents (about 67%) and drive recklessly without due regard to traffic laws and regulations. While these concerns are legitimate, they also reflect not only the self-indulgence\n\nof Ugandan elites but also equally their blindness to the concept of tradeoffs.\n\nSome of Uganda\u2019s elites are detached from the daily struggles of our youths! So they focus on the personal inconvenience they face at the hands of boda bodas and ignore the convenience this mode of transport creates for so many people in this country. They are also blind to the contribution boda bodas to the livelihoods of millions of our people and to our economy, both in monetary and also none monetary terms.\n\nLook at the economic impact of boda bodas: whatever your views about them, the total revenue generated by boda boda is anything from Shs13 trillion to Shs15.6 trillion per year, 10% to 12% of Uganda\u2019s GDP! They employ about 1.2 million youths, each of them earning (at a conservative estimate) Shs250,000 per week. And they provide livelihood to 6 million people (assuming every household on average has five persons)! And 90% of boda boda business is on passenger transport, not cargo!\n\nWhile our elites in Kampala focus to personal inconvenience at the hands of boda boda riders in the city, and use this to argue for banning of this mode of transport, they ignore the fact that the vast majority of boda bodas are not in Kampala. They are spread across the entire country. Indeed, in many parts of rural Uganda, boda bodas are the only means of transport to rush people to health centers in times of medical emergencies, carry goods and people to markets and mark the transition of many youths from dependence on agriculture to services for a livelihood, a process of transformational dimensions.\n\nBoda bodas have been off the streets of Kampala for two months, and in the rest of the country. If the president is not willing to let them carry passengers, he should provide a solution to the incomes of 1.2 million riders and the livelihoods of over 6 million Ugandans! If not, he should find ways to allow boda bodas to carry passengers while minimising the risk of spreading COVID!\n\nI am involved in boda bodas through a social enterprise that seeks to help unemployed youths own assets (boda bodas, refrigerators, omnibuses, special hire taxis and now we are thinking of motorised fishing boats) from which they derive their livelihood! As stakeholders we have ideas on how to allow boda bodas carry passengers with little or no risk of spreading COVID. Rather than make decisions alone, the government should have consulted stakeholders.\n\nMuseveni has taken an extreme view of COVID, suggesting that only saving lives from this single disease matters and all else is secondary. Yet earning an income is life saving as it helps people meet their basic needs without which they would starve to death. It makes no sense to save anyone from the risk of being killed by COVID only to meet certain death via starvation! We need to think of the economic destitution of a significant share of our people resulting from depriving them of their only source of livelihood for two months.\n\nIt also makes no sense for government to provide food for people who can provide it for themselves. In any case government has no resources to feed 6 million people who depend on boda bodas for a livelihood, and neither does it have the resources to meet their medical bills for others illnesses other than COVID. A balance has to be found on how to ease the lockdown and return the country to normalcy while minimising, as opposed to eliminating, the risk of the spread of the virus.\n\nThe focus on preventing the spread of COVID is commendable but the cost of the solution is increasingly becoming bigger than the problem itself. Uganda needs to find a creative balance between sustaining the economy and preventing COVID! We cannot kill the economy in the name of a utopian vision of preventing the spread of a disease that has no cure or vaccine! Uganda needs to plan how to live with COVID while minimising its spread. This can be achieved through effective administrative regulations, tight monitoring and tracking of potential victims, and building medical capacity to hospitalise the ill. So Mr President please open Uganda to boda bodas.\n\n****\n\namwenda@independent.co.ug", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/mr-president-open-boda-bodas-now/", "published": "2020-06-08T00:05:13+03:00"}, {"title": "Free COVID facemasks? Give me a break", "author": ["Andrew Mwenda"], "text": "How democratic politics has placed Uganda on a perilous road of an irresponsible and lazy citizenry\n\nTHE LAST WORD | ANDREW M. MWENDA | A dangerous, pervasive and malignant sense of entitlement has grown, spread and consolidated in Uganda. Many Ugandans believe they are entitled to various welfare benefits from the state in complete disregard to the resources available. Yet, at the same time, they have no corresponding sense of responsibility, for instance to pay taxes regularly and adequately to fund these welfare expectations. To make matters worse, our democratic process actively promotes this dysfunctional mentality. Elected politicians from President Yoweri Museveni downwards promise a nanny state in a country with hardly the requisite resources to pay for it.\n\nTake the example of COVID. The government of Uganda has promised to pay Shs35 billion to buy 35 million facemasks for nearly all citizens. This is crazy. According to its own admission, a facemask cost only Shs1,000. I do not know of any Ugandan who cannot afford this for their health and safety and that of their immediate family. Giving facemasks for free is likely to even undermine incentives for people to wear them as many will think they are useless. If people take their health seriously, they will buy the facemasks by themselves. Once they have spent their money on the masks, the incentive to use them will be very high.\n\nThere will always be recalcitrant individuals who will refuse to buy and wear masks. Government can and should make use of facemasks compulsory and then instruct police, soldiers and local defense units to ruthlessly enforce the rule \u2013 even by whipping those members of the public who refuse to abide by the rules.\n\nBack to affordability: I have visited many of the poorest parts of rural Uganda and the poorest slums in Kampala. There is MTN and Airtel, beers like President, Eagle Larger, Senator, Chairman, (each at about Shs 2,000), Pepsi and Coca Cola and an assortment of many other industry products. How do these private companies reach the far-flung remote corners and poor parts of Uganda selling products priced higher than Shs1,000 per unit? Indeed the presence of these products in these remote parts of Uganda is evidence of income among our poorest citizens.\n\nWhy then does government of Uganda, which has failed to provide adequate protective gear to health workers in hospitals, decide to spend large amounts purchasing facemasks to those who can pay for them? This is where democratic politics has prostituted policy in favour of populist gestures that are injurious to the economy. To win votes, politicians in Uganda have actively created an expectation among the public of a large basket of entitlements. Thus today, everywhere many Ugandans sit idly asking that \u201cgavumenti etuyambe\u201d (let government come and help us).\n\nThe danger to our country is this mentality of entitlement. It has eroded any sense of personal responsibility. Many Ugandans do not believe that their exaggerated expectations of the state have made them lazy and complacent. Instead of getting off their seats and finding something productive to do, many Ugandans want the state to find them jobs or create profitable trading opportunities for them. Meanwhile immigrant communities from Eritrea, Ethiopia, China, India, Pakistan etc. come to our country and make a fortune because they do not have this sense of entitlement.\n\nIndeed, there is a belief in our country that one is entitled to a well paying job if they get a university degree. In my many unhappy encounters with multitudes of young Ugandans online, I am always shocked, but certainly not surprised, by their lack of understanding of the keys to success. A university degree is not enough to get you a job. You need to possess marketable skills demanded by employers. Companies in Uganda lack skilled people to do work, and our country is importing large numbers of these skills from Kenya, Zimbabwe, India, China and other places.\n\nThe intellectual class and the mass media in Uganda have not helped matters. On a daily basis, they join politicians in the lexicon of pumping young Ugandans with this dysfunctional sense of entitlement that they are owed a living by the state; and sense of grievance that there are social enemies holding them down. Entitlement is combined with grievance to create a toxic political atmosphere in our country, thereby creating opportunities for demagogues like Bobi Wine and Kizza Besigye to rally followers.\n\nUganda is a very poor country. Its per capita income is about $850 in nominal dollars, $2,700 in purchasing power parity (PPP). This low per capita income predicts very low per capita revenue $122 or Shs450,000 and per capita spending of $195 (or Shs750,000). This money is grossly insufficient to pay for a large basket of public goods and services to the quality and quantity we desire and demand.\n\nThus, even if Uganda eliminated both corruption and wastage to zero, and poorly paid public officials starved themselves and their families to death in an altruistic effort at public service, we would still have less nurses, doctors, medicines and equipment in hospitals, fewer textbooks in schools, bad roads, thin policing etc. The fundamental problem of Uganda is not lack of political will to serve citizens. It is simply a problem of lack of requisite resources to fund a large basket of these public goods and services.\n\nYet on social media, Ugandans fret about how public officials are \u201cstealing our taxes.\u201d This ignorance is blinding. Ugandans simply do not pay taxes. Taxes are imposed on income directly when earning it as source (like Pay As You Earn \u2013 PAYE), or indirectly when spending it (consumption taxes). Only 620,000 Ugandans pay PAYE, of these the top 10% pay 80% of the tax in a country of 43 million. Agriculture, which employs 70% of the population, is not taxed.\n\nEssentially the government promises to serve citizens with free goodies while taxing only a few rich people, often foreigners. Someone recently told me that Indians who make only 0.1% of our population pay 64% of taxes. If this is true, it underlines my point. This is the cause of our persistent budget deficits and growing public debt. We prefer to borrow domestically and from abroad in order to avoid antagonising citizens via taxation. We need to stop this dysfunctional policy and get our people off their seats to work.\n\n****\n\nCLICK TO READ ONLINE MAGAZINE HERE", "link": "https://www.independent.co.ug/free-covid-facemasks-give-me-a-break/", "published": "2020-06-01T00:07:08+03:00"}]}, "BUKEDDE": {"link": "https://www.bukedde.co.ug/", "articles": [{"title": "Bakutte ababadde bateega abatuuze mu kafiyu", "author": [], "text": "More From The Author", "link": "https://www.bukedde.co.ug/news/1520756/bakutte-ababadde-bateega-abatuuze-mu-kaf", "published": "2020-06-12T15:10:07+03:00"}, {"title": "Omuyindi ayagala bamwongeze ku capati", "author": [], "text": "More From The Author", "link": "https://www.bukedde.co.ug/news/1520754/omuyindi-ayagala-bamwongeze-ku-capati", "published": "2020-06-12T14:35:36+03:00"}, {"title": "Enkalu ebadde mu kuziika Gen.

Uganda\u2019s then Minister of ICT, Frank Tumwebaze, attended the official opening of the NOC.\n\nThe probe also comes at a time when ZTE announced a partnership with a giant telecom operator here in Uganda by jointly launching the first 5G SA network in East Africa, demonstrating 5G use cases at an event themed \u201cExperience the Future Together\u201d. The event was at Nyonyi Garden, Kampala, Uganda.\n\nAccording to reports, the new investigation, which has not been reported previously, centres on possible bribes ZTE paid to foreign officials to gain advantages in its worldwide operations.\n\nThe fresh scrutiny on ZTE, according to reports, comes just after the end of the corporate probation period agreed to under the March 2017 plea agreement it struck with the Justice Department. Under the agreement, ZTE agreed to a civil and criminal penalty and forfeiture of $1.19 billion.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment, reports suggest.\n\n\u201cZTE is fully committed to meeting its legal and compliance obligations. The top priority of the company\u2019s leadership team is making ZTE a trusted and reliable business partner in the global marketplace, and the company is proud of the enormous progress it has made. Beyond this, it would not be appropriate for ZTE to comment,\u201d read a statement issued by ZTE.\n\nHowever, the transactions in which countries federal prosecutors are investigating could not be determined.\n\nBut under the 2017 agreement with the Justice Department, ZTE agreed to implement and maintain a compliance and ethics program to detect violations of sanctions and export controls. Implementing the programs did not give ZTE immunity for any past crimes the company had not disclosed to the U.S. government when the plea agreement was signed, the documents show.\n\nZTE\u2019s code of conduct bars employees from paying or accepting bribes in China or abroad, documents show. But news reports, documents and at least one lawsuit filed in recent years have accused ZTE of corruption in more than a dozen countries, including Algeria, Liberia, Kenya and Zimbabwe. In Kenya, for example, a document published by WikiLeaks in 2010 raises questions about how ZTE won a 2009 contract to install landline telephone monitoring equipment for the country\u2019s National Intelligence Service. What appears to be a report from then-U.S.\n\nAmbassador Michael Ranneberger to the State Department states that ZTE received the contract after paying kickbacks to high-level officials of the National Intelligence Service (then known as the National Security Intelligence Service), including one who received $5,000 a month, which he used to pay medical bills.\n\nThe document was among more than 250,000 classified State Department cables leaked to WikiLeaks and later made public. Chelsea Manning was convicted in military court of stealing the cables.\n\nRanneberger, who was ambassador to Kenya from 2006 to 2011, is now a managing partner at Gainful Solutions, a lobbying concern. He did not return phone calls seeking comment about the leaked report.\n\nZTE\u2019s stock is publicly traded on the Hong Kong market. The U.S. equivalent of it shares \u2014 its American depositary receipts, or ADRs \u2014 trade over the counter at around $7.25, down from a recent peak of $8.85.\n\nIn 2016, Norway\u2019s giant government pension fund banned ZTE from its investment universe based on \u201cthe risk of severe corruption,\u201d according to a report by the Norges Bank Council on Ethics. ZTE is one of about 150 companies whose shares will not be purchased by the Norwegian fund; most on the barred list are there for production of coal-based energy, cigarettes or nuclear weapons. Only three other companies are barred by the Norwegians for \u201cgross corruption\u201d alongside ZTE.\n\nIn the deal with the U.S. government three years ago, ZTE also agreed to a denial of export privileges that could be activated for seven years if the company committed additional violations. In mid-April 2018, the Commerce Department activated the denial of privileges after determining that ZTE had made false statements to the government about actions it had taken to punish employees involved in Iran and North Korea activities.\n\nWhile ZTE said it had reprimanded the employees, the government later found that the company had rewarded them with bonuses. Activating the denial meant that ZTE could not buy semiconductors required for its products. Three months later, however, President Donald Trump rescinded the sanctions as part of a trade deal with China.\n\nAs is typical with companies operating under plea agreements, ZTE was assigned a monitor to assess its compliance. James M. Stanton, a personal injury lawyer in Texas, was appointed monitor by Ed Kinkeade, the U.S. district judge in Texas who oversaw the government\u2019s case against ZTE.\n\nAlthough Stanton was charged with filing periodic reports to the court, none have appeared publicly. He did not respond to repeated emails requesting copies of his ZTE reports. Stanton is scheduled to continue as ZTE\u2019s monitor until 2022.\n\nRonnie Jacobson, Kinkeade\u2019s courtroom deputy, declined to provide redacted copies of the monitor\u2019s reports. Asked why, he said, \u201cBecause.\u201d\n\nZTE\u2019s corporate probation under the 2017 plea agreement ended Saturday. During the probation, ZTE agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department on any criminal investigations by U.S. law enforcement. Could this be another trade war between the U.S and China?\n\nAbout Post Author Maurice MUHWEZI | Managing Editor administrator http://3.23.50.92 Maurice Muhwezi is a distinguished Digital Media Manager with interests in areas published platforms, website management, team-building, business process improvement and creating e-customer solutions See author's posts", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/03/booby-trap-chinese-telecom-giant-with-links-to-uganda-probed-over-alleged-bribery/", "published": "2020-03-18T04:00:00+00:00"}, {"title": "EXCLUSIVE: Gen.

Suha (Barbra) Nekesa formally Barbara Nekesa Oudo have exchanged vows.\n\n\n\nWilly Ouma condemned Asuman Kiyingi a former Minister for congratulating Nekesa.\n\n\u201cSomeone takes another man\u2019s wife and you congratulate them instead of condemning it?\u201d\n\nBarbara Nekesa with Mr Oudo and son in happier days\n\n\n\n\n\nHow she came to abandon her home with Mr Oudo remains a secret we shall open soon.\n\nBarbara Nekesa hails from Busia town near the Uganda-Kenya border, was born on June 6, 1984. Nekesa was born in the Samia community to Mary Hadudu, also mother to nine other girls, and Edward Wabudi, a local councillor and absentee polygamous father.\n\nLight-skinned, medium height and cheerful, no one anticipated that this girl, would one day reach such political height as she has done today, not even herself.\n\nToday, however, Nekesa, a mother of two with her husband, Charles Oundo, a foreign service officer, is the woman Member of Parliament for Busia and the State Minister for Karamoja working under the First Lady as her boss.\n\nBecoming minister in her 20s\n\n\u201cThe day I was announced the winner for the parliamentary seat I had contested for had been a long happy day, and many had called to congratulate me. Just as I was about to switch off my phone, I picked up just one more call, to find the other person on the other end requesting me to tune in to UBC radio,\u201d she recounts.\n\nNekesa with Children of Mr Oudo\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI obliged, only to hear the new ministers and state ministers\u2019 being read out, and my name was among them! I was so overwhelmed by the news because it was something I never expected except by God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2011 when she became MP and later minister. Nekesa was only 27 years old, making it to the country\u2019s list of the youngest female politicians, alongside others like Parliamentarians Proscovia Alengot, who became MP for Usuk at 19 last year, and Joy Kaliisa Arinaitwe, 26, (Buhweju).\n\nHow she came to earn a ministerial appointment, she says she can only speculate it was her confidence and aptitude that earned it. She however, also vehemently dismisses the baseless rumours that the appointing authority, the President, was attracted to her. She may not have appointed herself minister or consciously influenced her appointment, but this daughter of Busia always had political ambitions.\n\nThe journey to the political pedestal\n\nNekesa\u2019s first stint in politics was in 1999 at Iganga Girls Secondary School when she served as deputy for the Uganda National Student\u2019s Association. The stint was good while it lasted but when she lost her bid for chairperson of the Women League of the same association she was disheartened and decided it was enough with the politics. \u201cI decided to concentrate on my studies and never to return to politics,\u201d she recalls.\n\nHowever, in 2008 while at Makerere University, her mother, who seemed to know her potential better, lured her back into politics, this time urging her to represent the women of Busia district in Parliament.\n\nIndulging her mother, she went onto the campaign trail for the February 2011 elections, reluctantly. \u201cI was, however, surprised when everyone seemed impressed by my first speech and that\u2019s when I knew I stood a chance,\u201d she recounts. And so it was that Nekesa was sworn in as the Busia Woman Member of Parliament at 27 years old, beating two other contestants to the seat. This breakthrough is what has currently culminated into her being minister in her late 20s, something she had never dreamed of, but is happy about.\n\nOf her future political plans, Nekesa says, \u201cI only believe in the present, what I have and what I see, so, I rarely talk of future plans. In fact, I have none because I believe everything is enabled by God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nA silent Member of Parliament?\n\nAbout the claims that she is one of the MPs that show up in parliament but do not really say much, she counters; \u201cSilent? I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m actually those annoyingly talkative people especially in the company of my agemates, but I just love to keep it reserved. I contribute regularly where need be, not on everything and anything that comes up, including things that I\u2019m not familiar with,\u201d she argues.\n\nAnd I can testify to her talkativeness, but maybe she is simply uncomfortable talking in the company of her senior cronies? \u201cNot at all. In fact, I look at our Parliament as a platform to mature my political life.

The issue is, there is no road to move the logs through Kaji Keji and also the dealers seem to be dodging the main entry in Afogi so the company opts to creating its own transportation route from Limi through Kweyo in Metu for Lorries to pass out of South Sudan\u201d the South Sudanese liaison officer says.\n\nIn addition, Capt. Duku notes that the rocky nature of the main route makes it difficult for travelers to pass via Kaji Keji, saying it\u2019s full of hills.\n\n\u201cI do see so many Lorries passing but I don\u2019t know if they are cleared.

Its within Kaji Keji county authority. The national government in Juba is not aware of what is going on in the States and counties. Since there are no state governors and county commissioners, its the executive directors who are responsible\u201d he points at a curtail depleting the natural resource in South Sudan.\n\nHe accuses the local authorities back home in South Sudan of inconsistencies on their stand to fight illegal logging in the country.\n\n\u201cI got a letter from one of the executive directors from South Sudan requesting Moyo RDC, Bob William Labeja, to stop transportation of the logs which were parked on Ugandan side but again I heard that there was another one contradicting the first letter, directing the impounded logs to be released but I have not received a copy of the last letter. It has not reached me\u201d he notes.\n\nThe liaison officer doubts why the purported second letter to authorize release of the logs did not pass through his office like the first one.\n\n\u201cThe first letters was brought to me and copied to Moyo Resident District Commissioner. It has now brought a lot of conflicts because the logs arrested were put down over accusations of the trees being illegally cut and also the lockdown due to COVID-19. Then, how could our authorities in South Sudan write another letter to release the logs, yet the problems why it was stopped have not ended and resolved?\u201d he wonders.\n\nIn such contradictory situations, Capt. Duku resorts to silence with only sending notification to his appointing authorities in Juba, about the controversial matter.\n\n\u2018You know people who are logging are very funny. When I see conflicting issues, I have to be silent. When you give a directive and then contradict it, it means that is another issue. That\u2019s why I keep quite. I give the report to the headquarters in Juba. Its because of the COVID-19 pandemic that the national government has not responded\u201d the South Sudanese representative explains.\n\nDespite claims of permission from South Sudan, authorizing transportation of the logs, Capt. Duku still receives phone calls on an alarming rates of illegal lumbering and transportation of logs across the border.\n\n\u201cI receive several phone calls from my people in South Sudan. They are telling me that lots of logging is being done and transported to Uganda. They are asking that this logging must stop\u201d he states.\n\nPerturbed of the persistent practice despite Koboko and Yei agreements, Duku recalls that before dissolution of state governments, the then Yei River state governor, His Excellence, Emmanuel Ades, resolved in meetings with RDCs in West Nile region to fight illicit trade on South Sudan forest products and it\u2019s transportation through Uganda.\n\n\u201cWe even conducted a meeting between RDCs of West Nile region and the Governor of the defunct Yei River state in Koboko and then in Yei. The talks were that logging must stop. These documents are there with the RDCs in West Nile region but still the logs continue to come out of South Sudan. A\u2019m now unable to talk because its beyond my responsibility. When I see these things happening, I also ask myself why do they permit such practices to continue yet they talked of stopping it, still the logs are coming and are being cleared\u201d Capt. Duku expresses.\n\nCapt. Duku holds county executive directors whom he accesses of connive with officials in revenue department, accountable for the unlawful practices in South Sudan.\n\nCapt.

The company exposes my community at a high risk of COVID-19 because they take some members to work at their site of lumbering in South Sudan and come back to interact with my people\u201d the area chairperson complains in his petition letter.\n\nHe notes that the activities have also caused environmental degradation in his village as trees were cut down during road opening for transporting logs from the area of lumbering in South Sudan to the site of storage at Kweyo village in Uganda.\n\n\u201cOn a sad note, we learnt that the LC 1 chairperson of Padiga North village has granted permission for the company to transport logs to the market where the sell but I urge the company to consider the recommendation letter of LC 1 Padiga North to be null and void as the project site is in my village and I have a complaint\u201d Mr. Driciri stresses\n\nThe village LC 1 boss and the community demandvan explanation on the use of the illegal route.\n\n\u201cMy office also wants to know why the porous border is used for this illegal logging to happen without the knowledge of my office and the community\u201d he states.\n\n\u201cThe community of Kweyo and Padiga North have co-existed in harmony and peace for a long period of time hence my office is in request to you, to hold the activities of logging until the grievances are resolved to avoid escalation and bloodshed\u201d he emphasises.\n\nIn the letter copied to the Moyo District Police Commander, DISO, LC V secretary for production, District forest officer, DLC Metu, LC 2 and the media among other institutions, the area LC expresses his desire for immediate action to this matter.\n\nIrked by a continued creation of illegal entry routes by smugglers, a practice that exposes the community to COVID-19 dangers, Moyo district LC 5 chairperson, William Anyama has taken the matter to president Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.\n\nMr. Anyama discloses to Red Pepper digital that he has written a letter, attached with several others about illegal cross border activities, including that of Kweyo village LC chairperson and taken to them to office of the President.\n\n\u201cYes, I got a copy of that letter and I have written to office of the president about it.

He has even written to Uganda Revenue Authority (URA)\u201d Moyo district chairperson gives details of evidences he has presented to State House.\n\nThe district boss counts the RDC among those aiding use og illegal entry points for transportation of logs from South Sudan.\n\n\u201cWhat the RDC is doing is outside the law. First of all, the logs are not transported using the gazetted border points. The formal border point with customs and URA officials is at Afogi but the loggers have opened new illegal entry routes into Uganda. One of the new entries and the largest is from Limi in South Sudan to Kweyo village in Metu Sub county\u201d he points.\n\nMr. Anyama says.\n\nThe logs, after transferring them from South Sudan, are first offloaded at Kweyo before loading onto trucks for the next destination.\n\n\u201cThey even store the logs in Kweyo village on Ugandan side of the border. This is illegal because even if Corona virus was not there, this act of using ungazetted entry routes, that poses a lot of threats. Security threats and Health threats to the people, more so the President has said, no more crossing the border\u201d the district chairperson fumes.\n\nHe lashes at the act as abuse of office and disrespect to lawful directives from the head of state.\n\n\u201cYou see what is happening, it\u2019s just a total abuse of office and abuse of government systems by people who are entrusted with the mandate to provide services, to provide security, to be in charge of enforcing presidential directives, ministry of health guidelines and guideline of World Health Organization. But these officers do not mind about the welfare of the people. They look at how to take advantage of cross border business to make personal gains. Its typically of what happens with the RDC who connives with some security officials in Uganda and South Sudan to enrich themselves\u201d Anyama notes.\n\nUsually, bordering districts like Arua, Koboko, Moyo, Adjumani and Amuru have got access to black market trade but the practice, is done at the risk of cross border COVID-19 transmission.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in South Sudan. It\u2019s even higher than we have here and how safe are the people in Moyo who go to South Sudan and get back to interact with relatives in Uganda? They go there to log trees and come back to Uganda and mix with the community. Some of the South Sudanese come using the same routes to freely stay among the community in Uganda. They also shake hands as normal. It\u2019s a total mess and they are protected by government security, contrary to the wishes of citizens. The security was supposed to safeguard citizens but they act against the directives of the commander-in-chief, to whom the forces were supposed to pay allegiance\u201d the LC 5 chairperson laments.\n\nAccording to Anyama, the illegal routes across the border are rampant incidents along Moyo district.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time. The other time, we made an effort to go to Moyo Sub county and found there were many illegal routes to South Sudan. Previously, we went and saw these people in the bushes with their equipment that include tractors, loaders and graders had crossed to South Sudan\u201d he reveals.\n\nEndangered tree species which the government is trying to protect are the target.\n\nThe Ministry of Water and Environment had issued a directive, stopping people from harvesting Afzelia Africana and Sheer butter trees which are mostly found along the Uganda-South Sudan border.\n\nMr. Anyama believes the loggers claim to be cutting trees in South Sudan but ones they are deep in the bushes, they cross to harvest trees on Ugandan side.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prove whether they are in South Sudan, Uganda or both sides as the border is not clearly marked in the Bushy areas. As they are also being protected by armed personnel, it becomes difficult for civilians to monitor these people due to fears of an encounter with the security.\n\nThe most recent wood logs transported through the illegal entry points were about 15 truck but before that, there were several others.\n\nUnfortunately, in South Sudan, it has become a way of the local authorities to raise revenue to run their government system including paying their workers using proceeds from illegal logging without the knowledge of the Central government in Juba.\n\n\u201cOne time, they wanted a company to go and work on their feeder roads in the counties and would pay in terms of logs. Imagine what kind of a contract one would sign! Its a batter trade with natural resources which is so precious yet we are talking about climatic changes. What is so special about South Sudan that can\u2019t affect Uganda? The effect of climate change will not stop at the border\u201d the district chairperson emphasises.\n\nMoyo Resident District Commissioner, Bob William Labeja became furious to Red Pepper digital when conducted to seek comments on the frequent appearance of his name in the illegal logging deals.\n\n\u201cThis is again about what! You have made up your position about the logging. Have you proved that there was illegal logging?\u201d the RDC demands.\n\nThe RDC\u2019s reaction follows an earlier published by Red Pepper digital where a whistleblower tipped the Anti graft body of the State House to investigate him for issuing permission, directing police and UPDF to release impounded logs.\n\nOn contacting him to verify the authorization letter, Labeja told Red Pepper digital that he was in a meeting and would call back later but he failed to date.\n\nHestating to comment on the subject matter, Labeja recalls a previous incident, claiming Red Pepper digital circulated a viral article about illegal logging in Moyo district.\n\n\u201cNo, you can not find out. You remember, you without confirmation, you went viral that there was illegal logging. I thought you, journalists when you are handling a situation you go for fact-finding. When you called me, I told you I\u2019m in a meeting. You mean I should have answered you in a meeting which I was chairing?.\n\nGo with the position of illegal logging. Go with it the way you wanted. Take it the way it is. Why do you call me? No, no, no, no. You, you, you, you go with it. I don\u2019t answer questions on the phone\u201d the RDC bubbles before terminating the call.\n\nTRIPLE CRIMES; illicit deals, on illegal routes at forbidden period of time.\n\nNone functionality of state and County governments in South Sudan coupled with lockdown due to global COVID-19 pandemic, offers ample opportunity for a curtail to transact illicit log deals across South Sudan-Uganda borders through ungazetted porous routes.\n\nIllegal entry points along South Sudan border are common and the biggest threats as the country records high COVID-19 cases with increasing death figures.\n\nAdjumani, Yumbe, Moyo, Koboko, Lamwo and Amuru districts that border South Sudan, receive illegal entrants of South Sudanese on daily basis posing the biggest threats to northern region of Uganda.\n\nSimilarly, several Ugandans returning home from South Sudan also use the same illegal routes to access their motherland.", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/06/south-sudan-uganda-border-for-illicit-trade-amid-rising-covid-19/", "published": "2020-06-10T19:31:27+00:00"}, {"title": "COVID-19 case rise to 3,094 as Kenya grapples with 105 new infections", "author": ["View All Posts"], "text": "Kenya\u2019s Health Ministry CAS Dr. Rashid Aman\n\nNairobi \u2013 Novel coronavirus cases in Kenya have surpassed the 3,000 mark after 105 more people tested positive in the last 24 hours.\n\nKenya\u2019s Health CAS Rashid Aman said the total number of cases in the country now stands at 3,094.\n\n96 of them are Kenyans while the remaining nine are foreigners from different countries.\n\nAccording to Dr. Aman, the new cases were reported from 2,273 samples that were tested.\n\nThe age range of the new patients is between 2 to 77 years while gender distribution is 77 males and 28 females.\n\nCoronavirus patients in Nairobi are from the following sub-counties: Ruaraka (14); Lang\u2019ata (5); Dagoretti North and Kamukunji 4 each; Embakasi West, Embakasi East and Kibra (3 each); Starehe and Westlands (2 each); Makadara, Mathare and Embakasi South (1 each).\n\nIn Mombasa, cases are distributed in Kisauni (5); Likoni (4) and Mvita (2).\n\nAll the cases in Busia, Turkana, Uasin Gishu, Kisumu and Taita Taveta are truck drivers from Malaba, Nadapal, Turbo, Kisumu Central and Taveta respectively.\n\nOne patient succumbed to the COVID-19 diseases in the last 24 hours bringing the total number of fatalities to 89.\n\nDr. Aman said the patient had been hospitalised at one of the health facilities in Nairobi.\n\nThe latest number of recoveries at 175 bringing the total number of those discharged to 1,048.", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/06/covid-19-case-rise-to-3094-as-kenya-grapples-with-105-new-infections/", "published": "2020-06-10T13:45:03+00:00"}, {"title": "NWSC MD Eng.

(PHOTO: File)\n\nKampala \u2013 Given the decrease of income to organisations and individuals in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Bank of Uganda (BoU) has urged banks to restructure loans.\n\nIn a discussion on the Fiscal and monetary policy for economic recovery from the effects of COVID-19 at NTV National Forum on June 5, Deputy BOU governor Dr. Adam Mugume encouraged commercial banks to do loan restructuring.\n\n\u201cAs we reopen, we have encouraged commercial banks to do loan restructuring. But most, 60% of their income comes from lending. The restructuring will lead to some losing this 60%,\u201d Dr. Adam Mugume said.\n\nThe senior economist Dr. Mugume also portrayed the BOU plan of aiding commercial banks in this COVID-19 economic crisis.\n\n\u201cAs Bank of Uganda, we decided to create a facility for these commercial banks to borrow some money at CBR rate so that they are able to stabilise as they wait for borrowers to pay back their loans,\u201d Dr Adam Mugume explained.\n\nHe further analyzed the problems affecting agriculture sector. The impact of seasonal climate forecast (SCF) and how to manage climate variability.\n\n\u201d Agriculture, if you remove SCF, it is charged the highest interest rate because it is risky. If you exclude SCF, the interest rate will be around 24-25%. This is a big problem. Right now Uganda needs people to sell locally but also export so that we can close the import-export gap. Mindsets have changed over the years with Ugandans now exporting agricultural products they previously imported\u201d Dr Adam Mugume said.\n\nDeputy Secretary to the treasury in the Ministry of Finance Mr. Patrick Ocailap tipped farmers to adopt technology to boost quality produce.\n\n\u201cWe need to link up the production of Agriculture with technologies that would boost quality and help with the process of farming like irrigation and use of solar tech to pump water to various farms. Import substitution and export promotion starts with improving the productivity and production of the agricultural sector where we all agree Uganda has got a very tremendous comparative advantage\u201d Patrick Ocailap said.\n\nNotably, the executive director at financial sector deepening Uganda, Rashmi Pilai argued Ugandans to think in terms of incentives to achieve what they want.\n\nShe further argued organisations to find solutions without losing their employees.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be able to ride through the storm and not just corporations, \u201d Rashmi Pilai said.\n\nIn addition, Ocallap advised small businesses to base their planning on realities, not on aspirations.\n\nThe COVID-virus have created circumstances where many economic rules, teachings and assumptions don\u2019t apply in the same way.\n\nNotably, GDP is usually the most visible goal, with economic policy often focused around maximizing economic growth.\n\nHowever, the virus forces us to shift priorities rather than worrying about GDP, we need to worry about saving lives.

However, since the trial is with the candidate classes and institutional finalists, the above worries may be handled appropriately given ample spacing in class, labs, compound, dormitories and proper washing hands with soap and facemasks.\n\nSecondly, how will learners from border districts equally benefit \u2013 given that some have to trek from one border district such as Busia to Tororo where they study from or Ntungamo to Kabale which presents an interesting scenario on how learners in Universities in border districts are going to cope.\n\nThis raises important technical aspects as to whether such learners will equally compete with their counterparts in the final examinations such as PLE, UCE, UACE, and the like.\n\nThirdly, how will day scholars manage routine movement in the absence of affordable transport system given that the half passenger directive will lead to hiking of fares and yet even boda bodas are not allowed to ferry passengers. This is one area that stakeholders need to brainstorm on accordingly.\n\nLastly but not least, it is imperative that school fares be discussed extensively since learners are reporting for another term factoring in the economic hardships arising from the closure of businesses where parents used to earn from.\n\nIt should be brought to the attention of concerned government stakeholders most especially the President and MoES that most private sectors have not been paying their employees and some have suspended and terminated employee contracts which will greatly impact on how many parents will be able to send back their children to school bearing in mind exorbitant fees charged by most schools both public and private.\n\nSome of the issues raised above require government intervening to subsidize at least for the candidate classes in terms of supplying food and a few scholastic materials so that schools reduce what parents have to pay.\n\nMoES should put strict school requirements so that schools do not put much pressure on requirements such as hoes, slasher, dozens of toilet paper, dozens of books, sugar, cooking oil, after all, the majority end up in shops again.\n\nIn addition, to support parents who work for the private and third sectors of the economy whose earnings are already in jeopardy, parliament should expedite the process of amending the NSSF Act to allow access to savings during emergent situations as a mechanism of bailing out parents.\n\nLastly but not least, government through parliament should push for the need to increase funding to Student Loan Scheme where parents can borrow from to foot school bills in the short and medium-term to cater for learners in primary and secondary levels in addition to those in higher institutions of learning.\n\nAll the above measures among others if well thought have a high probability of revamping the learning needs of the populace with unprecedented desirable outcomes.\n\nDr. CHRISOSTOM OKETCH | [email protected] | Kabale University", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/06/dr-chrisostom-oketch-school-reopening-is-a-timely-trial-and-error/", "published": "2020-06-02T09:01:23+00:00"}, {"title": "FRANK BULIRA: Nyumbani Story & Dilemma of Being Minister\u2019s Wife in Museveni\u2019s Uganda", "author": ["View All Posts"], "text": "Florence Tumwebaze is a well-accomplished lawyer in her own right legitimately running her own law firm called KABIBI & Co Advocates based in Kampala.\n\nShe is youthful and also holds an MBA making her adequately qualified for employment anywhere including in a government MDA. Instead of looking for government employment [which wouldn\u2019t be hard because her husband Frank Tumwebaze is an influential Minister in Museveni\u2019s government and compared to the ease with which officials get fatty jobs for their spouses, relatives and cronies], Florence has opted to hassle as many young people do.\n\nBesides her modest law firm and legal practice, she also oversees the day to day running of the family businesses which struggle to find business opportunities like any other. Key among these family businesses is Nyumbani Hotel in the poor slummy neighborhood of Kikoni which is famous for cheap hostels and accommodation facilities.\n\nI personally live in nearby Nakulabye and I therefore frequently eat out at Nyumbani and that is how I peripherally come to know about Florence\u2019s struggles which are barely any different from what all of us ordinary mortals go through on daily basis to make ends meet in this dusty city of Erias Lukwago.\n\nThis [Mon] afternoon, one of the members on one of the many whatsapp groups where I\u2019m a member posted a social media link of a crudely written news story branding Florence scandalous simply because her Nyumbani Hotel featured among those few that risked all the stigma and accepted to serve as quarantine centers for the confinement of Ugandans and foreigners who had returned to Uganda from abroad at the height of the anxiety Coronavirus had created among Ugandans.\n\nBecause I travel frequently in the region, inland and even globally, I know how hotel managers were reluctant to participate in such quarantining operations notwithstanding the prospect of making some money. I and other friends shunned, for example, Gilbert Bukenya\u2019s Katomi Kingdom Hotel, which we used to frequent, simply because rumour went round it had been involved in hosting some of the suspected COVID cases under quarantine.\n\nYet Florence took the risk of facing the stigma for her business and took in these quarantine cases at a time not many hotels were willing to let them in. The difficulties in taking them in were not just about the resultant stigma but also the prospect of not being paid at all because the quarantined kept crying of being very poor people.\n\nWe all remember how the original arrangement was that those quarantined would pay for themselves all the expenses involved in the quarantining period stretching between 14-21 days.\n\nAt Nyumbani, as I learnt from the frightened employees who often serve me as their client, each of the quarantined adults was to pay not more than Shs200,000 for the lodging, day & night resting and the meals including morning tea, evening tea, lunch and supper.\n\nMind you; feeding well in right quality and quantities is one of the ideal things one must do especially while facing COVID-related uncertainties as that is one sure way to boost one\u2019s immunity which increases survival chances.\n\nAll these cases at first used to be managed at Entebbe-based Central Inn which government abandoned after pressure mounted from the public and MPs that the $150 (over Shs500,000) that was being charged per night was too much.\n\nNnyumbani Hotel \u2013 Makerere \u2013 Kinoni\n\nThe Ministry of Health and government then settled for Kikoni for a number of reasons including the fact that there was a possibility to get cheaper accommodation facilities because that exactly is what the place is famous for. The other reason was that students had been sent home and many of those huge structures were vacant.\n\nAnd then most importantly, it was the place nearest to Mulago hospital (in case emergencies arose and one needed urgent access to the national referral hospital for proper management) were the cheapest facilities could be found.\n\nThe alternatives to that would be Kamwokya, Mawanda Road, Ntinda, Wandegeya etc whose facilities wouldn\u2019t only be less ideal ()because of the resultant congestion) but are also more expensive.\n\nRemember these are people who had rioted, with support of everybody, against Central Inn because it was too costly. The Health Ministry had to be careful to avoid similar accusations of hiding behind COVID to exploit the already struggling Ugandans.\n\nIn the end, Nyumbani, Grand Global and even Hon Nyombi Thembo\u2019s Douglas Villas hotel were chosen as acceptable and available by the health ministry and those requiring quarantining services began being kept there under close management. It depended on what one preferred basing on affordability.\n\nSome voluntarily went to Nyumbani, others Douglas Villa or Grand Global. After all they would each pay for themselves. Much later on when government came under too much pressure from legislators, media and the public, a decision was taken that GoU takes up the responsibility to pay these accommodation charges for whoever got quarantined at any of the designated facilities.\n\nWhereas the prospect of government being the one to pay initially created excitement even among workers at these facilities, owners must be regretting because the Health Ministry, whose very strict PS Diana Atwine Kanzira is Florence\u2019s sister, hasn\u2019t yet made any payment.\n\nAnd the toll this huge expensive venture, of having to decently feed people for so many days without being promptly paid, has taken on Nyumbani Hotel is visible to me each time I pass by what used to be my favourite hangout place.\n\nThe staff don\u2019t seem to be motivated as before because of the COVID-related stigma and some of the friends we used to go there with have a lot of stigma towards the facility and their apprehension is because it participated in hosting potential COVID cases.\n\nThis is the reason I shared the pain Florence naturally must have endured when I read the social media demonization aimed at scandalizing her simply because her sister Diana Atwine is PS in government and her husband Frank is Minister in the same government. I haven\u2019t stopped wondering what people in Florence\u2019s shoes, and they are many, are supposed to do in contemporary Uganda.\n\nOrdinarily, somebody as qualified as she is (lawyer with an MBA) should be holding a powerful government job somewhere while earning very well without even having to hassle much. But here she is toiling like all of us to earn livelihood only to get stigmatized simply because of who she is related to either by birth or marriage? As someone who knows something about her struggles like any other business person in Kampala, I find such attacks malicious, uninformed, crude and very rudimentary. In fact, whereas Florence is a down to earth lady,\n\nNyombi Thembo isn\u2019t repentant about anything. He publicly admits there is nothing wrong he did offering his Douglas Villa to host Ugandans at a time many facilities were unwilling to.\n\nA former Minister in Museveni\u2019s government, just like Tumwebaze is, Thembo says he saw this as an opportunity to sacrifice future business opportunities (in case his business suffers future stigma and gets shunned) in order to serve humanity in his country Uganda. Just like in the Tumwebaze case, Thembo\u2019s Douglas Villa, where I was once a resident, is managed by his wife who equally struggles to get and access business opportunities like any other person in Kampala.\n\nNotwithstanding our political differences and desire to character assassinate some people, what should such spouses or even children do? They went to school and naturally have some opportunities because of who their husbands or fathers are but haven\u2019t used that to insist on getting lucrative government employment, like many their peers do, but have chosen to go and hassle like all the other private citizens in the private sector\n\nI have reflected on the latest social media attacks on Florence over and over again but I have failed to understand what wrong she has done apart from merely being wife to Frank my namesake and sister to PS Diana Atwine.\n\nI would like to hear things like the service offered was inadequate both in quality and quantity. Things like her charges were outrageous making her business the least appropriate to host such people and yet she still got the business simply because she is PS\u2019s sister.\n\nThings like that. To my mind, the circumstances that led to these people being confined at her facility are such that there isn\u2019t much anyone can fault her for beyond just making reference to her blood/marital relations! It\u2019s fallacious for anyone to argue or demand that because Florence is Frank\u2019s wife, she shouldn\u2019t do any business or earn anything out of her legitimate sweat.\n\nTo agree with such defective reasoning is to demand that a well-accomplished lawyer like Edwin Karugire shouldn\u2019t legitimately practice law anywhere in Uganda because she marries the President\u2019s daughter. That Prince Jjunju shouldn\u2019t do any work, including selling his legitimate skills to radio CBS, simply because Ronald Muwenda Mutebi, the reigning King of Buganda, is his father.\n\nYes, it is legitimate to criticize those holding public office while holding them to high standards but it\u2019s important that we qualitatively improve the criticisms we make. In this case, it\u2019s very possible that the target of those behind the authorship of such social media rants could be targeting her spouse or sister in the broader schemes of intrigue that are common in President Museveni\u2019s government.\n\nThe authors were so careful and deliberate not to mention anything about actors like Honorable Godfrey Kiwanda the tourism Minister who was thickly involved in identifying and dealing with these facilities to host the suspected COVID cases. As someone outside government circles,\n\nI guess that Kiwanda had to be involved not for any selfish reason or motive but because some of the people that found themselves involved in this quarantine business are visitors who were for tourism-related engagements only to be caught in the melee as Ugandan borders got locked down.\n\nAbout Author: Frank Bulira is Kampala-based social justice activist.", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/06/frank-bulira-nyumbani-story-dilemma-of-being-ministers-wife-in-musevenis-uganda/", "published": "2020-06-01T20:43:57+00:00"}, {"title": "Businesses That Survive The Corona Crisis Will Do It Online.", "author": ["View All Posts"], "text": "A business that makes money through the corona crisis, will do it online. If you are a small business owner who is reading this and have yet to expand your business online, now wouldn\u2019t be the worst time to think about doing so (Dreavity Digital Agency to get started). In the last month, internet traffic in Uganda has grown by over 30% overall with some sectors seeing over a 60% increase. East Africa has seen its WhatsApp usage and online gaming traffic surged by seven-fold and three-fold respectively. In a bid to stem the overwhelming flow of online activity, Netflix is even making the decision to slash traffic by up to 25% to help relieve the strain being caused to internet service providers. Utilising these resources will prove to be the only way a business will survive the corona crisis.\n\nStay-at-home measures making people spend more time online\n\nWith people beginning to embrace the changing social landscaping and having no choice but to live online, businesses must make the decision to direct their primary form of marketing there. Previously, physical marketing was one of the leading ways to reach people. Since the new advice regarding social distancing and the stay-at-home measures that are being put in place, we have seen congestion in City suburbs decreased by 47% and Kampala saw a reduction of 51%. If we look at China, where their strict lockdown policies are slowly lifted, their road traffic is still down by 50%.\n\nEmpty roads\n\nAdults are working from home or not at all and have a lot of free time on their hands. Children are no longer in school and either learning online or on their PlayStation\u2019s. The time people would have otherwise spent meeting friends, going for dinner or the gym is now being replaced with browsing social media, YouTube or other online channels not knowing what to fill their time with. In the last few years, Facebook had been experiencing a gradual decrease in engagement, but since the beginning of the corona crisis, millions of people have been rediscovering the social media site for far longer than the average times before. In Africa, Facebook traffic has increased by 50% from one week to the next.\n\nSocial platforms keep gaining popularity\n\nIf your businesses had been considering starting a digital marketing campaign in the last few years but could not find the perfect time or reason to, then now is not only the best time to,(Dreavity Digital Agency to get started) but it may be a key consideration for all businesses in this current battle. With loneliness from self-isolation swallowing people\u2019s lives, public gatherings banned, many people are turning to Facebook\u2019s main instant messaging platform, Messenger, to contact their friends and fill that social void that COVID-19 has created in society. Since last week, Messenger has seen an influx of users and witnesses an increase of 70% more video-calls.\n\nfacebook ads\n\nFacebook Ads is a growing industry and the ad space is becoming more and more saturated as more and more companies begin to realise its potential. With the challenges modern businesses are currently facing due to coronavirus, many are being forced to turn to these channels to continue to operate. However, as coronavirus keeps spreading and physical marketing channels get thrown to the wayside the window to utilise this opportunity gets ever so smaller. This is why, for a small or medium-sized business, the time to act is now (Dreavity Digital Agency to get started)and step foot onto the digital front or fear being left behind by their more proactive competition.\n\nIt is not just on Facebook, but on other online channels, whereby Ads potential is also massive: such as Google, Bing or Twitter, where Xanda has enjoyed years of success, strategising campaigns with Ads usage at those most relevant times.\n\nSource: Dreavity Digital Agency", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/05/businesses-that-survive-the-corona-crisis-will-do-it-online/", "published": "2020-05-27T07:09:07+00:00"}, {"title": "'ZOOM Booming': Live Public Webinar Sessions 'hacking' Precautions - Red Pepper", "author": ["View All Posts"], "text": "Without preparations, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to several businesses resorting to remote working in just a matter of days. T\n\nhis situation, therefore, led to a burst in video conferencing, cloud-based e-meetings, educational webinars as a digital alternative to the social distance, which ensures safety from COVID-19.\n\nEverything may seem perfect in a closed user group e-meeting or webinar with a group of acquaintances. However, what if you had a public session on one of these many freely available cloud conferencing tools like ZOOM, Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook live, or Hangout with different audiences who have different expectations and intentions? Could these platforms\u2019 engagements be compromised by malicious audiences? What possible compromises and interruptions could be expected? Can they be minimized? How could hosts ensure minimal interruptions to public webinars?\n\nIn one of my recent public webinars hosted by Milima Security \u2018Pursuing a Cybersecurity career during and post COVID-19\u2019 using ZOOM video conferencing, we had just over 50 attendance. However, the session was \u2018zoom boomed\u2019 with inappropriate content shared on the chats and deliberately loud inappropriate audio from a few audiences microphones continents apart.\n\nThe zoom bombing disrupted the session for almost five or slightly more minutes till the host started removing subscribers who had not muted their microphones. Of course, such experiences can have some negative impact on the overall session environment. You don\u2019t know all who they\u2019re in the audience. Could the host have muted all microphones and chats in an interactive webinar? If the host did just that, where would the interaction be? It was such a learning experience for us to make future webinars even more productive.\n\nSo, what to look out for when organizing a public webinar?\n\nChoose the tool that gives you more control over your audience\u2019s contribution and participation. You may have to pay a small subscription for more control features. Some audiences in open login webinars are just idle and are not in the session for any good. Avoid random logins and setup registration forms before the session starts so you can audit attendance. Set up some \u2018webinar\u2019 house rules before the start of each public webinar session. Like, we are not disclosing unnecessary personal information, muting microphones if one is not contributing, sticking to time allocations, avoiding offensive or inappropriate content sharing, and ensuring stable internet connectivity to avoid dropouts. The host should not forget to remind the audiences of NOT sharing confidential company information during a public webinar session. Public webinars can be an attractive environment for criminals to harvest users personal information or do reconnaissance. The audiences should be encouraged not to activate their webcams if it is going to show too much information about their household interiors.\n\nAnd take extra precautions when you have to share more information with someone you met in the audience during a public webinar session.\n\nAbout author: Sam C.

They do so in very public ways, such as hijacking websites or forcing them offline.\n\nTheir symbol is a Guy Fawkes mask, made famous by Alan Moore\u2019s graphic novel V for Vendetta, in which an anarchist revolutionary dons the mask to topple a corrupt fascist government.\n\nWhat actions have they taken?\n\nVarious forms of cyber-attack are being attributed to Anonymous in relation to the George Floyd protests.\n\nFirst, the Minneapolis police department website was temporarily taken offline over the weekend in a suspected Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.\n\nThis is an unsophisticated but effective form of cyber-attack that floods a server with data until it can\u2019t keep up and stops working \u2013 in the same way that shopping websites can go offline when too many people flood it to snap up high-demand products.\n\nA database of email addresses and passwords claiming to be hacked from the police department\u2019s system is also in circulation, and is linked to Anonymous.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that the police servers have been hacked and one researcher, Troy Hunt, says the credentials are likely to have been compiled from older data breaches.\n\nA page on the website of a minor United Nations agency has been turned into a memorial for Mr Floyd, replacing its contents with the message \u201cRest in Power, George Floyd\u201d, along with an Anonymous logo.\n\nOn Twitter, unverified posts have also gone viral, apparently showing police radios playing music and preventing communication.\n\nHowever, experts suggest it is unlikely to be a hack, and could instead be the result of a stolen piece of hardware being commandeered by protesters on the scene \u2013 if the videos are genuine in the first place.\n\nAnonymous activists are also circulating years-old accusations against President Trump, taken from documents in a civil court case that was voluntarily dismissed by the accuser before it went to trial.\n\nHave they acted over race issues before?\n\nDespite there being no single unified approach among Anonymous\u2019 members, the group has targeted groups over race relations in the past.\n\nIn 2014, when the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, prompted widespread protests, members of Anonymous threatened to target the city if protesters were harmed.\n\nThey then disabled the city\u2019s website, compromising communications at city hall, and targeting the city\u2019s police chief.\n\nLater that year, they \u201cdeclared war\u201d on the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), releasing personal details of alleged members online.\n\nSome Anonymous members also attacked the campaign group Black Lives Matter\u2019s website over alleged \u201canti-white racism\u201d.\n\nIs this return credible?\n\nGeorge Floyd\u2019s death has led to what the BBC\u2019s New York correspondent Nick Bryant described as the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968.\n\nIt is against this backdrop that a Facebook page claiming to be linked to Anonymous released a video about Mr Floyd\u2019s death, alleging a string of other crimes involving Minneapolis police, and threatening to act.\n\nThe same Facebook page posted similar videos about UFOs and \u201cChina\u2019s plan for world domination\u201d in recent weeks which \u2013 like the George Floyd video \u2013 feature an electronically-disguised voice discussing previously published news stories.\n\nBut it received much wider attention after the Minneapolis police department\u2019s website appeared to be knocked offline.\n\nIs this the kind of cyber-attack that ANONYMOUS is typically associated with?\n\nThe first major Anonymous operation to make headlines was against the Church of Scientology in 2008, in which it used DDoS attacks to knock some of the organisation\u2019s websites offline, along with prank calls and empty fax messages designed to disrupt their communications.\n\nIn the years that followed, in the aftermath of a global financial crisis, the group acted in support of the Arab Spring protest movements, targeted Sony Entertainment over its attempt to crack down on hacking of the PlayStation 3 console, and supported the Occupy Wall Street protests, among others.\n\nThey have continued to lend support to similar causes, and staged anti-establishment rallies around the world, but their prominence in mainstream media had diminished in recent years.\n\nThe revolutionary image and willingness to take on powerful entities, however, appears to be striking a chord during the current crisis in the United States.", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/06/hacker-group-anonymous-re-emerge-amid-us-unrest/", "published":

I thought about this seriously and I decided to make things with my Lord by being frequent in church.\n\nOne good Sunday, a very cute babe walked to the pulpit and confessed that she had been selling her yoyo to almost all villagers and was now ready to repent.\n\nThis babe was about seven months pregnant and did not know the father of her unborn baby. The girl gave her testimony and it was all touching .I felt a holy voice inside me pestering me to give this cutie the support I can. After the service, I walked to her and assured her that I would accommodate her and give her all the necessary support for her and the unborn baby.\n\n\u201cOh praise God, Am called Speranza, and you?\u201d She asked smiling from ear to ear. \u201cI am Hyena, \u201cI answered. Anyway, I welcomed her in my room, bought for her every type of food she wanted to eat. Since I did not have an extra mattress I agreed with my sister in Christ that she would sleep on the mat until I got enough money to buy an extra mattress.\n\nOn the fourth day, in my home, she began wearing skimpy maternity dresses that could expose her bums and knickers. I was not taken up because she was my sister in Christ. You see in the Pentecostal church, it is unacceptable to develop sexual feelings for any member of the church.\n\nMy worry then was to get money to buy her a mosquito net since she was pregnant and probably a mattress and a blanket because she was covering her body with her dress. Sometimes I would wake up late in the night and find her fighting with the mosquitoes, I felt concerned.\n\nAfter her twelfth day in my house, it rained so heavily. We ate supper and slept. Then at around midnight, she woke me up saying that something was biting her. She told me that it was because she was not used to sleeping on the mat without a mattress. She started crying saying that she wanted to come up and sleep with me.\n\nAt first, I refused because I feared she would doubt my faith. She requested me to be kind to her, and I accepted. She came up and we covered our bodies under the same blanket. We did it for three days, and nothing happened.\n\nBut on the fourth day, I started feeling her warmth and her nipples started piercing me. Still, nothing happened. On the fifth day, she slept while crossing with mine, and I cuddled her fat belly. She did not say a word; instead, she unzipped my trouser and held my whopper in her hands. She gave me a tremendous handjob. I was very high.\n\nShe then got a condom from her money purse, dressed my stiff whopper without saying a word. She sat on my whopper and started bumping herself. She did it while rubbing her nipples vigorously and screaming, \u201cHyena I love you ooh ooh.\u201dI did not say a word.\n\nShe jumped off, pushed two of her fingers into her Kandahar and smeared the waters on my whopper then made several circles with her fingers on my lips.\n\nIt felt so sensational. I then inserted my fingers into her for about ten minutes, she screamed, \u201cbrother Hyena I love you so much.\u201d I fingered her seriously until she got her orgasm. When she was done, I mourned her and bonked her missionary style.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes, I felt my spoof flowing out; I removed my whopper, ripped off the condom and masturbated myself on her Kandahar entrance. She got up immediately and cleaned my whopper with a piece of cloth. It erected again, I condomised it and inserted it in her Kandahar. This time the Kandahar was too hot. I bonked her for more ten minutes and started breathing heavily.\n\nThis time I bonked her roughly till she screamed: \u201cayi, ayi, brother Hyena, onzita.\u201d But she was not Cumming yet I wanted her to cum and we call it a day. I pushed her against the wall and turned her for a goatee.\n\nThis time she released juices sticky like office supper glue. \u201cBrother Hyena, webale naye nkusaba onyongere kubanga nkufiraako,\u201d (thanks brother but I wanted some more I am dying for you) she said.\n\nShe positioned herself for a doggie and widened her Kandahar hole. I shafted her mercilessly until she screamed aloud. I heard myself pouring out so I removed my whopper and masturbated outside again. The sperms this time splashed the entire room including on her face.\n\nShe jumped off the bed and picked my trousers; she used it to clean her face and came back on the bed. The whole room smelt sperms and Kandahar juices. I pushed her down for another missionary. I bumped her this time so fast and her Kandahar went saying po po po.\n\nShe tried to push me off her body but I couldn\u2019t let her go. This time I heard about million babies crying from my whopper going down to her Kandahar. She started screaming on top of her voice that yaaaaaaaaaa. We had double orgasms. She cleaned my whopper and we began talking. She told me that she loved me so much and there was no way she would express that love to me rather than okumpako (give me). S\n\nhe said since she came to my house she was sniffing my pants and trousers whenever I was away. From that day on, we bonked each other every night. I asked her how I would call the baby she was going to produce and she just laughed.\n\nI told her that by the matter of fact, if she calls me Mwami, the baby she was going to deliver would be my son.

She was the kind who would give you a very passionate kiss and allow you to touch wherever you wish but when it came to releasing her fruits she would disappear in thin air. That did not scare me, because all the babes who have tried to detooth me have paid the hard way.\n\nFor about two weeks, she had been dodging me. Whenever I would demand to be paid for my services, she would either feign the moon or headache. Sometimes, she would tell me to wait for her in my room, but she would never show up. But with me, you either give me when I want or you never. So, one good Friday evening we met at the bar and I told her that I wanted her that very day or she should never talk to me.\n\n\u201cOmanyi mukwano nandibadde nkuwako naye mukama wange tanzikiliza kuva wano nga bakasitoma tebanaba kugenda,\u201d (sweetheart, I would have given you some today but my boss cannot allow me to leave before the customers have left) she said.\n\nI spent two days without going to her bar, she felt concerned and sent one of the bar boys to come and check on me. You see, when mercy fails you have to improvise so I gave the guy UGX5,000 to lie to her that I was suffering from hysteria and was calling out her name. Nalugabe was at my theatre in no minute not knowing what was in store for her. She locked the door as soon as she came to my room and I bolted the door, and there we were just the two of us.\n\nMy whopper was more than happy to see her and it was already ticktocking, and ready to attack. I smiled widely and told her she was mine forever. \u201cHyena nkwegayiride tokikola munange nsibye,\u201d (Hyena please don\u2019t commit that sin I am fasting), she said. I was already charged and I could not let her go, at least not me- no one ever leaves my theatre untouched.\n\nShe held the bedpost but I outwitted her and carried her on my shoulder to the bed. \u201cHyena nkwagala naye ogenda kuntama kati lwaki oyagala kunzina nga nze sesimide\u201d (Hyena I have been loving you but now I will hate you. Why do you want to bonk me against my will?), she said.\n\nI told her to simplify things by putting herself in the mood and enjoy the game. \u201cKale ngenda kuwako naye kimanye nti onsobezako mbade sikiyina ku timetable yange,\u201d (okay I will let you bonk me but know that you have raped me because I had not planned for it), she said. I removed her blouse exposing her ripe hard nipples and sucked them dry. She started the hmmm uuumm eeeiii oooh arrr. I stopped for a minute and admired her brown rather white face and black breasts.\n\nLooking at this babes face, you would think she is a white woman but her legs are as black as charcoal. Her Kandahar was half shaven making an O shape. I pulled her long twinnies and tied them into a rope which I kept on pulling as she screamed in ecstasy. I went down there and licked her roughly.\n\nI opened it widely using my tongue exposing her pink bean-like clit. All the time she was twisting and wiggling her flabby butt in all directions. I plunged my rod deep into her wide open Kandahar and told her to raise her legs for me to feel her wet pot better.\n\n\u201cKulikayo sebbo enno ye dakku yange munange nsimye nyo era okuva lero gwe taata wabana bange\u201d (welcome sir, from today you are the father of my kids), she said.\n\nWhatever she meant, I did not care, all I wanted to know was where my chicken thighs and beers were going. I reached for my lifeguard studded condom, dressed my bulging whopper again and showed it to her for approval. Her Kandahar was already dripping juices; I looked down and realized they were making a trail on her legs.\n\nI first inserted there my middle finger and told her to lick her juices and confirm to me if my beers were equally tasty. \u201cDaddy nawe toyonona obudde nzina kuba mpulila nfa yanguwako omukwano gwo Nina mungi\u201d (Daddy don\u2019t waste time I have much love for you just bonk me am dying of passion), she said. When I asked her why she had been denying me access to her pot for so long, she just smiled and covered her face with a pillow.\n\nHer legs were wide open at 1800 degrees; I slid my whopper, and then remembered I hadn\u2019t treated her to the western jazz. I pulled it out and began jazzing her making slow circular motions, then drawing zig-zag lines using my whopper in her wet Kandahar.\n\n\u201cHyena nkwegayilide gitekemu,\u201d (Hyena, please enter me), she pleaded. I did not enter her I wanted to punish her for delaying to release her fruit. To punish her more, I went down on her and started licking her. \u201cRusajja gwe nawe nzina,\u201d (you idiot screw me now), she screamed splashing salty water from her Kandahar into my mouth.\n\nShe pushed me away and started fingering herself. Watching her die with horn turned me on. My whopper hardened, I jumped on top of her and humped her missionary style.\n\nAfter about two minutes, I felt my waters come again, I increased the rate at which I was bonking her, then I felt her Kandahar muscles hold and release my whopper. I knew she had finished, I released my waters and we both finished at the same time and I pulled out instantly.", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/05/hyena-classic-tale-14-matchmaker/", "published": "2020-05-21T20:24:57+00:00"}, {"title": "HYENA CLASSIC TALES #13: \u2018Oouuchhh, that\u2019s so ticklish\u2019", "author": ["View All Posts"], "text": "Hyena strikes , languishes in tanks of El Nino\n\nAt the beginning of February, I happened to visit Kigali.

I was very delighted to go with him and he assured me that I would drool right from the border to the city centre.\n\nI remember we got into Rwanda through Kagitumba border, to the city centre, as we cleared at the immigration office; I spotted some not so juicy babe who was chewing gum like it was sugarcane.\n\nThe way she kept moving her tongue in and out made me imagine her licking me. I was immediately turned on. I walked to her and asked her to help me with some of the information on the form I did not understand.\n\nShe told me her name was Chantal and she was coming from a business trip from Kampala. She was using the jaguar bus and I convinced her to use our truck since it had some extra space and would take her straight to her home.\n\nChantal willingly accepted and immediately boarded our truck. Since we were all using the front seat, she sat very close to me. Her warm succulent thighs turned me on. We had reached somewhere around Rwamagana when the truck ran out of fuel. There was no petrol station nearby, so my friend Gatare had to rush and bring some fuel from a petrol station which was about sixteen kilometres away, leaving me and Chantal in the truck.\n\nI held her close to me, and she rested her oily hair on my chest. I blew warm air into her ear and pushed my rough tongue deeper to taste her bitter wax.\n\n\u201cOuch, Hyena that\u2019s so ticklish,\u201d she said, almost into tears. \u201cOk Chantal let me do it somewhere else where it won\u2019t feel ticklish,\u201d I suggested. I went down on my knees, pulled her kitenge up a bit, pushed her mother\u2019s union on the side and rubbed my tongue on her long twin towers. \u201cHyena ibyo simbishaka,\u201d (Hyena I do not want that) she said as she moved her pot closer to my lips. I rolled her long twin towers on my tongue, and warm slimy juices flowed out of her wide Kandahar.\n\n\u201cPrudence, prudence,\u201d she said. I did not have any idea of what she was saying until she pulled out a packet of condoms from her handbag. Next time you are in Kigali, do not ask for condoms they do not have a single idea of what condoms are, just ask for prudence plus.\n\nAnyway, I rolled on the condom and made her sit on me like I were a chair. Both of us faced the same direction and she held the steering like she was driving the truck away.\n\nHer Kandahar felt warm and fresh and the position in which she was seated allowed me to have deeper penetration. We were humping ourselves roughly that we finished at the same time. The expansion and contraction of her Kandahar muscles turned me on the more.\n\nI immediately rolled on another prudence plus and stared jazzing her. \u201cCherie, oranyikira igituba ibyo simbikunda,\u201d (my darling you are killing my pot I do not like that) she said.\n\nI then stopped jazzing her, \u201ckomeza,\u201d (continue) she said while rubbing my whopper roughly against her twin towers. \u201cBut I thought you do not like that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWowe uri specialie,\u201d (yours is special) she said still jazzing herself.\n\nGatare had already brought the fuel.

When we were done, I called Gatare and we drove off. I fingered Chantal from Rwamagana to Kigali but she was not getting her orgasm. She kept pushing my fingers deeper and deeper but it seemed not to help.\n\nWhen we reached a place called Remera, I booked a small hotel room and we shagged ourselves to satisfaction.

She was very thankful and asked me to her home that evening. I felt so flattered though I accepted the offer.\n\nShe directed me to her home in Makindye mukizungu and told me to join her for dinner. She told me her name was Duc and I knew I would forget it so I noted it down in my phone book. At about six, I was at her gate; she had already told her gateman about me so did not find any problems explaining about myself.\n\nI was treated like a king and she kept telling me how hospitable Ugandans are. I assured her that I was not a thing for all Ugandans but just the few who think and care for the foreigners. Ofourse I wanted her to think of me as \u2018that special Ugandan.\u2019 I realized there was no sign of male specie in her home, I tactfully inquired about her husband and she told me that he works in kabale but checks on her every weekend.\n\n\u201cSo madam, do you have any job for some poor guy like me,\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat are your qualifications? She asked. \u201cI can do anything ranging from laying the bed to cleaning the ashtray (blow job),\u201d I answered. I then changed the topic and asked her if she could allow me to touch her hair. \u201cWhy would I refuse you to touch my hair, you saved my life, come on touch it,\u201d she said while moving towards me. I told her I wanted to touch on her body to see how it feels. \u201cYou can touch wherever you want, that bugger could have taken off with my bag,\u201d she said.\n\nI again requested to taste on her lips.\n\nI continued stroking her hair. I licked her whole face and blew hot air into her ears. Am sure she loved it because after some minutes she started aah, eeh, waah, hmm in ecstasy. I slid my finger into her slim Kandahar and fingered in slow motion. Her taps opened up and poured warm magma into my hands. I licked my fingers, inserted them in her again and made her lick her own warm magma.\n\nShe tore off her clothes like a madwoman, wrestled me on the floor and peeled off my clothes. She sucked my whopper as she wiggled her flat butt like a piston. She looked old but her tits were strong and stiff. I went down on her and sucked her pink pot dry. She went on top of me and put her ass right into my nose. I sniffed her smelly hole and rolled my tongue into her A**hole.\n\nShe screamed in ecstasy and increased the speed at which she was sucking my whopper and rubbing my balls vigorously. I then felt her Kandahar muscles squeeze and release my tongue sensationally and I knew she had finished.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to leave her yearning for more so I turned her for my famous jazz and hit her big Kandahar north east, west and centre vigorously that she sighed with relief when I stopped. I then turned her for a missionary; she took me in whole heartedly and thanked me for the job well done. We did it for almost an hour and we were disrupted by a call from Yasmin my chotera babe.\n\nI lied to the muzungu that my sister needed me, so I rushed to take a shower and she followed me there. She positioned her rear pot in my face and told me to lick her again. I did it as she supported herself on the tub and told me to enter her from behind. I did whatever she told me to do and in a minute she let out a milky spout. She then pinned me on the wall and swallowed my whopper.\n\nI poured my cum into her mouth and she swallowed it with pleasure. I put on my trousers and she offered me her husband\u2019s t-shirt. She called her driver and told him to drop me at my place. Yasmin asked me why I had taken long to get back home and I lied to her I was out with my friends. When we got to bed, she faced the wall and told me to enter her from behind. She caressed my whopper but it could not get up. Yasmin stood up, looked at me in the eye and ordered me to tell her what was going on.\n\nI pretended to be drunk but she couldn\u2019t let me rest. She rained slaps and blows in my face. I tried to run away but she pulled me back and told me to bonk her or lose her for good. I had to do something, I shook my whopper rapidly and it stood. I bonked her vigorously until she told me to stop. That night I slept like a real king. Imagine having a mixture of Italian and chotera Kandahars!

Every night she made sure that I had a super babe to warm my bed. Some girls used to come with her, not knowing that she was setting them up for me. Almost all her friends who came to my home knew what to do.\n\nThere was this particular Karamojong babe who proved to be very stubborn. Every time she would come with my sister, she would decline to contribute anything on the bonking topic.\n\nThis babes name as Evelyn. She was dark, skinny, with very minute bums. Although she had nothing special about her, I wanted to enter her Kandahar to discover what it felt like to bonk a k\u2019jong. One day, I presented to her my manifesto and she told me that, even if I danced on a needle, she would never let me enter her.\n\nSo many times I tried to push in my whopper from behind as she bent washing my clothes, but this babe was a real warrior she would wrestle me and tell me to joke with local babes who give their goods for free. She claimed that hers was worth so many cows not Rolex. I asked her what I would do for her to let me taste her fruit but she assured me that she was already engaged to a fellow k\u2019jong and needed nothing from me.\n\nI tried to out reason her that people don\u2019t steal from deserted houses but the ka-girl assured me that she heard of that before so nothing was new to her. I somehow gave up but because there were many babes craving for my whopper and I feared her bony Kandahar would hurt me. Years run very fast and she finished campus without letting me taste her bony Kandahar.\n\nThe reunion\n\nSix years later, I met this babe at a reunion party organized by Makerere students Association. I realized she had added some weight and was in the company of a huge guy. She was so excited to see me and introduced me to her friends as the \u201cfunny guy I used to tell you about.\u201d They all laughed, leaving me wondering what she used to tell them about me.\n\nI tried to ask them how funny I was but instead they laughed louder; it made me feel uncomfortable. After we had exchanged phone numbers, I excused myself but promised to call her sometime. At the party, I was in the company of some babe called Tina. Tina is a good friend of mine though we sometimes bonk when we get a little high, I met her when I had gone to bench for some fool called Sheila. This Sheila was not in her room and decided to pick on her roommate Tina.\n\nCompassion\n\nTina was so sweet and she had the longest twin towers I had ever encountered. Meanwhile Evelyn was bombarding me with messages, asking me whether I was still interested in her. I assured her that her chance had long gone and I was committed to someone serious with me. I wonder how women think, she was accusing me of using her yet I had never slept with her.\n\nI took it cool and told her I was willing to take her back into my life. I directed her to my muzigo and told her to drop by anytime she feels like. She immediately told me she was willing to spend a night at my place. I then went and lied to Tina that my sister had had an accident and I had to run to the hospital immediately.\n\nShe insisted on going with me but I convinced her that it would be better for her to stay and enjoy the party with her friends. I promised to call her when I get to the hospital. I said all this in a hurry so she doesn\u2019t get to say any word.\n\nThe fruit\n\nI was happy I was going to enter that Promised Land between a karimojong\u2019s legs. On my way home, I bought a box of rough riders ready to butcher my prey. I shook my whopper in all directions to make sure it was strong enough. Within a few minutes, we were at my place; I didn\u2019t waste my time asking her why she had denied me access to her pot all that time.\n\nAll I did was to first pin her on the wall and plant a very passionate kiss on her wide lips. I carried her to my bedroom and gave her a thorough licking before fingering her. Her Kandahar was so rough like sand had been poured in there. This turned me on the more. I condomised my whopper and started jazzing her. To my surprise, she pushed me away, saying it was going to widen her Kandahar. She told me that she preferred the in and out movements.\n\nI did that for some time and she was just mute. I started jazzing her again and eventually she started singing in her mother tongue. She was wiggling her tiny butt rhythmically and the millet grains in her Kandahar matched very well with the roughrider and brought out a very strange sensation.\n\nShe got up in the middle of the night and started sucking my whopper. I turned her for a goatee and inserted my gu-thing deeper, she yelled on top of her voice and told me to go and take all the cows in Karamoja.\n\nThis time, she gushed out the slimy stuff; I dipped my finger into her Kandahar and licked them. I pushed the fingers into her Kandahar again and made her lick her own juices from my fingers. I feel like seeing her again to have a taste of her salty Kandahar waters. Evelyn, why don\u2019t we meet tomorrow on this very page?", "link": "https://redpepper.co.ug/2020/04/hyena-classic-tales-11-the-soundtrack/", "published": "2020-04-18T09:26:00+00:00"}, {"title": "Horny Jinja Renowned Maggwa Based Prophet Nabbed Bonking", "author": ["View All Posts"], "text": "Even when God in the book of Ezekiel 34:10 declares, \u2018\u2019this is what the Sovereign LORD says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock.

Attending teenagers' dances almost every Saturday and Sunday at New Life, Mengo later renamed Economic Night Club after the exodus of Indians and Pakistanis in 1972.\n\nWasswa loved dancing and was a regular at Afrigo band's performances. Ggwanga to many who knew him was an enigma. But he was shy, yes very shy for those who knew him. The shades he donned masked his shyness. Without shades, he would feel naked and disarmed. He was a human magnet, wherever he was, crowds would gather to hear what he had to say, and he never disappointed.\n\nKasirye Ggwanga reviewing some of Nuwa's art pieces\n\nHe loved people and would do anything to help where and whenever he could. He loved children, all children biological or non.\n\nDid I mention that he also loved and collected my art? Well, he did, and would occasionally drop in at my studio/gallery for a visual feast and chat. He was always in search of knowledge through reading and watching TV. He would go on and try to implement what he would have read and seen! Sometimes to disastrous results.\n\nAs a teenager, he would stir up things and when the fight broke out he would disappear in thin air. However, that changed drastically after the basic military training in 1972 in Bombo Military wing. He became extremely fearless and daring.\n\nThe 1979 war, followed by two years of detention in Tanzania and the years he spent in the bush fighting the murderous Obote regime shaped his view of life in terms of what was, is and should be. And when the opportunity to try his luck on the ballot box came, he jumped on it. Kasirye was unanimously elected political head of Mubende District but preferred to be referred to as governor as opposed to chairman according to the Ugandan constitution.\n\nWhy the governor title? Of course, the American influence, where he had spent a whole year attending a course at Fort Leavenworth Staff and Command College, and too, growing up we had watched a lot of American movies especially Cowboy ones aka Western movies. He also believed in the federal system of government. To many, especially those with roots in Mubende, he remained the Governor until his death.\n\nHe loathed hypocrites, despised the corrupt, abhorred bullies and avoided idleness. He had an enormous heart with several compartments, in which anyone would fit. He was also extremely impatient with non-performers, but generous with whoever presented a need to him.\n\nAlthough he was tough looking as he appeared, Kasirye Ggwanga was an extremely emotional man and would breakdown at the news of the passing on of a beloved one! And such occasions were many! Man Nowa (Nuwa) tuggwaawo! He would say.\n\nThe most amazing thing is that he was loved by many from near and far including those who had never met him and only knew him through his pronouncements in the media. Then there were those who resented him because of his lack of sugar-coated utterances. He said what he meant and meant what he said. That was Kasirye Ggwanga!\n\nThe President and Commander in Chief, while delivering a Hero's national address interrupted his speech to announce the passing on of a hero, in real-time! He ordered the entire nation to observe a moment of silence in the General's honour! The nation obliged and soon there was an outpouring of grief at the confirmation of Ggwanga's death.\n\nIf indeed people love him, going by the number of outpouring emotions following his passing, then let every mourner plant a tree in his honour and memory. And may the powers that be declare total war on all those engaged in environmental degradation, land grabbing and corruption in any form. Here I must aver, Corruption is getting what you don't deserve whichever way. Oh, how I wish a forest would be planted in his honour and a compilation of his sayings be published into a book.\n\nI thank the Almighty God for according me the privilege and the honour of meeting, getting to know and sharing a lot with Maj Gen Wasswa Kasirye Ggwanga. The General lived up to the Namukozi motto: Okutya nsonyi; Obuzira kitiibwa. Loosely translated: cowardice is shameful; Bravery is honourable.\n\nMajor General, Brigadier, Colonel Kasirye Ggwanga as many civilians would fondly call you, believing Colonel was your first name and Brigadier a nickname; you didn't live in vain.\n\nRest in peace my friend, My Brother.", "link": "https://observer.ug/news/headlines/65241-kasirye-ggwanga-the-shy-but-obstinate-general", "published": "2020-06-12T16:27:11+03:00"}, {"title": "Court orders Makerere to reinstate Stella Nyanzi, pay Shs 120m", "author": ["Wadada Rogers", "Wooden K."], "text": "The High court has ordered Makerere University to reinstate suspended research fellow, Dr Stella Nyanzi after the institution was found in contempt of its own staff appeals tribunal.\n\nLady Justice Lydia Mugambe also ordered the university to compensate Nyanzi with Shs 120 million, promote her to the rank of senior research fellow and pay all her salary emoluments.\n\nThe judge found that the university was in contempt of its staff appeals tribunal by failing to promote, paying and reinstating her on job as the tribunal had previously ordered.\n\nIn November 2018, Nyanzi through her lawyer Isaac Ssemakadde dragged Makerere to court, accusing the institution of failing to implement the orders of the tribunal.

This statement, therefore, summarizes the economic policy underlying the Budget estimates. It is with pleasure, that I deliver this speech on behalf of H.E. the President.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMadam Speaker, today, we face unprecedented times. The global Corona Virus pandemic has, without exception, impacted lives and economic activity across the world. The pandemic has worsened the effects of climate change and the locust invasion that Uganda and the region had already been grappling with.\n\nUganda has been reasonably successful in dealing with these emergencies. Allow me to commend His Excellency the President for his visionary leadership in the fight against these natural disasters and emergencies.\n\nMadam Speaker, these emergencies have adversely impacted the economy. The livelihoods of many Ugandans have been negatively affected with declining household incomes, and in some cases the loss of jobs and food insecurity. Economic activity has drastically declined, with reduced demand for agricultural produce, the disruption of input supplies to manufacturers, as well as a disruption of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) activities. Inflows of Foreign Direct Investment and remittances of Ugandans in the diaspora have also declined sharply.\n\nMadam Speaker, the crises we have recently faced cannot, however, distract us from our long-term development strategy. These emergencies, indeed, present several lessons and opportunities that we have drawn on to craft the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy I will elaborate today. These opportunities include the following:-\n\nThe acceleration of our import substitution and export promotion strategy for a range of goods including medicines and other health products; and the products of agro-industrialization and light manufactures, which Uganda can produce with a comparative advantage;\n\nDigitalization of many aspects of socio-economic activity to improve efficiency and reduce costs. This can be applied through e-Commerce; e-Government (including tele-conferencing, procurement and the dispensation of justice); e-Learning; robotic automation, artificial intelligence, cyber security and cloud computing; and digital marketing in tourism. This permits to fast-track implementation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR);\n\nStrengthening contingency planning to mitigate the impact of disasters, and protect the most vulnerable persons;\n\nTransforming Informality of doing business to being formal\n\nReform of Urban Transport to reduce congestion, starting with the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area and eventually Regional Cities;\n\nDomestic tourism stimulation to encourage many Ugandan residents to explore local touristic destinations.\n\nMadam Speaker, we shall therefore seize these opportunities and continue on our path to developing an integrated, self-sustaining economy as laid out in the NRM Ten Point Programme. Uganda will also actively promote the development of African and global markets to enable access by Uganda entrepreneurs. The NRM Government shall therefore profitably add value to the range of agricultural products and minerals that Uganda is endowed with, as guided by H.E. the President in the State of Nation Address.\n\nWe shall build a strong and durable economy addressing the eight fundamental human needs namely; Food, Clothing, Shelter, Defence, Human Resource Development (Health and Education), infrastructure (electricity, roads, rail, ICT, Telecoms), and Spirituality. This will establish a firm basis for Service industries such as tourism, hospitality (hotels, bars, night clubs, casinos, etc) as well as entertainment (concerts, sports, etc) to flourish.\n\nMadam Speaker, the budget has therefore been based on the following theme: \u2018Stimulating the Economy to safeguard Livelihoods, Jobs, Businesses and Industrial Recovery.\u2019\n\nMadam Speaker, in my statement today, I will therefore do the following:-\n\nTake stock of progress in Economic and Social Transformation that forms the foundation for Uganda\u2019s resilience in the face of the emergencies we have faced and continue facing;\n\nPresent the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy; and\n\nPresent the financing framework underpinning the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy.\n\nProgress In Economic and Social Transformation\n\nMadam Speaker, the NRM Government has taken great strides to establish a strong foundation for economic and social transformation over the last five years during the implementation of the Second National Development Plan (NDPII). The strong foundation we see today has built the resilience we can see in the face of emergencies that we have recently faced. I will highlight some of the achievements we have registered in this regard, before spelling out the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy:-\n\nNational Output\n\nMadam Speaker, the Uganda economy has continued to grow, despite the effects of the recent emergencies we have faced. Uganda\u2019s GDP in the year 2019/20 is estimated to amount to U. Shs. 138 Trillion. The economy is estimated to grow by 3.1 percent this financial year ending 30th June 2020, slower than the average growth rate of 5.4 percent in the previous four years. Had it not been the emergencies we have faced in the last six months, the rate of economic growth would have been at least 6 percent per annum.\n\nThe Agriculture sector grew by 4.2 percent up from 3.8 percent in the previous four years. However, Industry grew by only 2.3 percent compared to an annual average of 7 percent in the previous four years. Services grew by 3.6 percent over the year compared to the annual average of 5.6 percent in the previous four years. These statistics demonstrate the effect of the recent emergencies that the country has faced. Despite the temporary shocks the medium term outlook for economic growth is positive and will be stronger given the measures we will implement.\n\nPrimary Production\n\nMadam Speaker, substantial progress has been made in Primary Production. The Agriculture sector plays a central role in Uganda\u2019s economy. It accounts for 45 percent of exports, and employs 64 percent of all Ugandans and 72 percent of all youths, thus its importance to influencing household incomes.\n\nPrimary production of commodities has increased significantly. Coffee production increased from 5.7 million 60-kg bags to 7 million bags between 2017 and 2019. Fish catches have grown from 391,000 Metric Tons to 561,000 Metric Tons between 2017 and 2019. This was largely as a result of the strict enforcement of fisheries regulations and addressing challenges of poor quality fingerlings and limited access to feeds. A total of 13,800 acres of sugar cane have also been established at the Atiak Sugar Factory in Northern Uganda and more is planned when the Amuru project starts.\n\nHuman Capital Development\n\nMadam Speaker, the wellbeing of Ugandans has also improved significantly over the years. For instance:-\n\nThe literacy rate of Ugandans in 2018 increased to 74 percent of all adults compared to 72 percent in 2014;\n\nMaternal mortality have reduced to 336 per 100,000 births from 438 per 100,000 births in 2011; and under-five child mortality has reduced to 64 per 1,000 births from 137 per 1,000 births in 2011\n\nAccess to safe water in rural areas today is at 69 percent increasing from 65 percent in 2015; with 38,500 villages representing 66 percent of the total 58,000 villages in the country having been provided clean water.\n\nAccess to safe water in urban areas stands at 79 percent, compared to 77 percent in 2015, with the piped water main network increasing from 17,600 Kilometres to 20,200 Kilometres. Over 66,000 new customers were connected during the year, bringing the total number of connections to over 720,000\n\nRural sanitation coverage is at 79 percent; while sanitation in urban areas increased to 87 per cent\n\nEconomic Infrastructure\n\nPower: Madam Speaker, we continue to make long strides in developing Economic Infrastructure. Witness this:- Electricity generation capacity now stands at 1,254 Megawatts, with the completion of the 42 Mega Watt Agago-Achwa II, the 76 Mega Watt Kyambura and the 5.9 Mega Watt Ndugutu Power projects. The 183 Mega Watt Isimba Power Project and its transmission lines was commissioned and the 600 Mega Watt Karuma Power Project is 98 percent complete and is due for commissioning in November 2020. The Karuma - Kawanda Transmission Line is also 82 percent complete. Construction of Nyagak III Power Project also resumed in May 2019.\n\nThe electrification of industrial parks has also progressed with the commissioning of the Mukono and Iganga Industrial Parks sub-stations. Under the Rural Electrification programme, 14,820 kilometres of medium-voltage power lines and 10,280 kilometres of low voltage distribution power lines have been constructed. Since we launched the free Electricity Connections Policy in November 2018, 277,500 rural households have been connected with a target to connect 300,000 rural households annually.\n\nTransport: Madam Speaker, transport infrastructure has improved considerably with the stock of the paved national road network today totalling 5,600 kilometres increasing from 4,300 Kilometres in 2015. The meter gauge railway network is under rehabilitation. The railway currently facilitates transportation of 18,000 tons of cargo monthly, and 2,000 passengers daily in order to support decongestion in Greater Kampala. In the air transport sector, thirteen (13) aerodromes have been rehabilitated countrywide and the expansion of the Entebbe International and the construction of the Kabale International Airports are progressing as scheduled. Uganda Airlines is revived and began operations during the month of August 2019.\n\nInformation and Communication Technology: Madam Speaker, ICT services have also performed well over the period. Internet users have increased from 7.5 million in 2016 to 11 million in March 2020. Total telephone subscriptions, of which mobile connections constitute 60 percent, increased from 21 million in 2016 to 28 million in January 2020. The value of Mobile money transactions increased from 3.4 Trillion in 2016 to 7.2 Trillion in March 2020.\n\nThe National Backbone Infrastructure now covers forty-nine (49) districts, 480 Ministries, Agencies and Local Governments, and 7 border posts. The monthly average unit cost of internet bandwidth for One Megabite per second (1Mbps) on the Backbone has reduced from $300 to US$70. The 500-seater ICT Innovation Hub at Nakawa was also completed during the year. Furthermore, one hundred seventy two (172) ICT Innovators were supported under the National ICT Initiatives Programme (NIISP) to develop e-Solutions. Some of their software applications have been used for business continuity during the Corona Virus lockdown.\n\nPosta Uganda launched Community Information Centres in Kitgum, Kasese, Moroto and Mubende to enhance provision of information on government services and programs. Posta Uganda also successfully implemented the International Postal System (IPS) at Forty-eight 48 District Post Offices, enabling improvement in international and national operational efficiency in timely exchange of post.\n\nScience, Technology and Innovation: Madam Speaker, in the Science, Technology and Innovation Sector, core projects have, too progressed well. For example, the Machining Manufacturing and Industrial Skills Training Centre (MMISTC) at Namanve was commissioned in January 2020. The centre will provide industrial skills training and apprenticeship, and manufacture high quality precision machine parts and accessories.\n\nMadam Speaker, the first phase of the construction of the Kiira Vehicle Plant at the Jinja Industrial Park is 50 percent complete, and two (2) Kayoola Electric Buses have since been developed, assembled and tested under a Technology Transfer project with China High-Tech Corporation.\n\nGovernance\n\nMadam Speaker, to improve urban security, Phase One of the Safe City CCTV project has been rolled out in Kampala Metropolitan, Wakiso, Mukono & Entebbe. Crime surveillance has also been enhanced with the deployment of LDUs across the country. The UPF also conducted Electronic Profiling of guns which will help to curb gun-related crimes. Consequently, crime levels reduced by 9.8% from 238,746 cases reported in 2018 to 215,224 cases in 2019.\n\nMadam Speaker, to increase access to justice we have established One Stop Justice Law and Order Sector Centres, each consisting of a court, and Police services, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Prison Reception centres, Probation and Community Services, in 84 districts across the country. In addition, plea bargaining was instituted to decongest court and improve the court efficiency. Consequently, cases aged over 3 years old have reduced from 24% in 2017 to 17% in 2019.\n\nMadam Speaker, to improve public service delivery, systems across Government have been developed and integrated as follows:-\n\nthe e-visa/works permits systems and the integrated Border Management System is now operational at 11 border posts and was extended to 17 Uganda Missions abroad that can issue visas to intending visitors. Consequently, average monthly visa applications have increased from 4,500 applications in 2016 to 12,700 applications in 2019;\n\nelectronic-passports have been integrated with the National Identification and Registration Agency (NIRA) register leading to a reduction in passport issuance from 10 working days in 2016 to 4 working days today;\n\nbusiness registration now takes four hours; and\n\nService Uganda Centres have been established at 18 Zonal Offices to eliminate bureaucracy and reduce cost of doing business.\n\nMadam Speaker, the fundamental progress in the socio-economic transformation of Uganda that I have highlighted is a result of the NRM Government\u2019s holistic development strategy. This socio-economic progress provides an underlying resilience to Uganda\u2019s economy, which has enabled us withstand the temporary disruption of the Corona Virus pandemic, the locust invasion, and the effects of Climate Change.\n\nEconomic Stimulus and Growth Strategy\n\nMadam Speaker, the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy that the NRM Government will implement commencing next financial year and in the medium term, is aimed at achieving the following three key objectives:-\n\nImproving wellbeing of Ugandans;\n\nBoosting economic transformation; and\n\nImproving peace, security and good governance\n\nMadam Speaker, these objectives address the three most critical aspects of Uganda society namely:- the peoples\u2019 welfare, the viability of farms and businesses, and the social eco-system in which they exist and is a major determinant of their future prospects. I will now detail interventions in each of them in turn.\n\nImproving Wellbeing of Ugandans\n\nMadam Speaker, in pursuit of improving the wellbeing of Ugandans, Government has identified interventions that address their welfare, namely:- (i) Food Security and Good Nutrition (ii)Enhanced Healthcare provision (iii); Ensuring Universal access to Water and Sanitation; (iv) Increasing Social Protection for the most vulnerable population; and (v) Transforming Education Delivery. I will now detail the specific measures to be implemented in each area.\n\nFood Security and Good Nutrition\n\nMadam Speaker, the Corona Virus pandemic has brought to the fore the need to ensure adequate food security and nutrition. Food security and adequate nutrition is of paramount importance for a healthy and productive life and it is a major factor in healthcare as it reduces the burden of preventable diseases and malnutrition. It also contributes significantly to reduced maternal, neonatal, and child deaths.\n\nUganda is blessed with adequate rainfall and arable land which provides the necessary condition for agricultural production, adverse climatic conditions notwithstanding. The 14 products that have been identified by H.E. the President, will therefore be developed commercially. These products are maize, cassava, banana, beans, Irish potato, sweet potato, millet, sugar cane, cattle (beef), dairy, coffee, tea, cocoa and fish. To reduce post-harvest loses, the construction of storage facilities of 42,000 Metric Tonnes capacity that commenced in Iganga, Isingiro, Amuru, Kalungu, and Nebbi will continue.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to improve Nutrition, Government will aggressively implement programmes to ensure adequate sensitization and awareness of all Ugandans on the benefits out of good nutrition for their health and wellbeing. I would like to encourage all Ugandans to embrace healthy living through nutrition, wellness and active living. All Ugandans should place due emphasis on physical and mental activity by exercising regularly and making healthy choices of food, and by reading and writing.\n\nEnhanced Healthcare provision\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to promote health for all Ugandans, Government will strengthen health systems. In this regard, health spending has been increased to ensure the recruitment of additional health workers and also provide for their welfare.\n\nIn order to deal with the Corona Virus pandemic and other similar epidemics that may occur in the future, Government has prioritized the purchase of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Additional funding has been provided to increase Intensive Care beds at National and Regional Referral Hospitals. Funding has been availed to procure Corona Virus test kits and other materials in order to curb the spread of the virus and ensure readiness for possible secondary waves of infections, if they should occur. Government will enhance surveillance and decentralisation of management of the Corona Virus in the country. Government will also support scientific research and innovations especially in vaccine development.\n\nMadam Speaker, further measures to strengthen health systems include the following:-\n\nUndertake mass sensitization and awareness on immunization, the use of mosquito nets to prevent malaria, HIV/AIDS prevention and the prevention and management of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD);\n\nDevelop Centres of Excellence for delivery of specialized medical care by completing the construction of the Uganda Heart Institute, establish centres for cancer treatment at Regional Referral Hospitals; and commission the Regional Hospital for Paediatric Surgery at Entebbe and fast-track construction of the International Specialised Hospital of Uganda at Lubowa;\n\nStrengthen the supply chain for medicines and medical supplies to improve the availability of medicines and ensure accountability thereof. Many of these medicines will be manufactured in Uganda; and\n\nEnsure Health Centres IIIs are functional with health workers, basic medical equipment, supplies and medicines. The total number of functional health centre IIIs is 1,327 and 41 health centre IIs are being upgraded to health centre IIIs next financial year.\n\nEnhance access to Safe Water and Sanitation and Utilities\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to ensure universal access to safe and clean water and improved sanitation, we will consolidate and build on achievements I reported earlier by undertaking the following interventions, details of which are in the Background to the Budget:-\n\nConstruct nine (9) Gravity Flow Schemes (GFS), Forty (40) solar powered Water Supply Systems; and drill four hundred and fifty-five (455) water wells;\n\nConstruct thirty (30) Water Supply and Sanitation Systems; develop Bulk Water Transfer Master Plans and Designs for fifteen (15) Water Supply and Sanitation Systems;\n\nConstruct twelve (12) small scale solar power irrigation schemes, twenty (20) parish-level and thirty (30) small scale irrigation schemes;\n\nIntensify monitoring and forecasting of weather and water levels, floods and effectively disseminate information to guide policy actions by stakeholders; and\n\nEnforce environment protection regulations for settlements on lake shores, riverbanks, wetlands, forests and flood prone areas.\n\nProviding Emergency Social Protection\n\nMadam Speaker, Uganda\u2019s vulnerable population, including the elderly, require protection, more especially to address the aftermath of the recent emergencies. Government will therefore prioritise targeted support to the most vulnerable groups and those at higher risks of food insecurity, old age and the chronically ill. To this end we will: -\n\nContinue to provide relief aid in response to the Corona Virus crisis, and natural disasters such as the locust invasion and climate change crisis \u2013 floods and landslides. This will allow the rehabilitation of adversely affected schools, health units, water points, and other social infrastructure and provide relief for vulnerable households affected. An allocation of U Shs 45 billion has been made towards this intervention; and\n\nRoll out the Social Assistance Grant for the Elderly (SAGE) nationwide to persons aged 80 years and above, including the elderly aged 65 years in the piloted 15 districts. An allocation of UShs. 107 billion has been made for this intervention.\n\nTransforming Education delivery\n\nMadam Speaker, education plays a central role in the development of human capital. In order to improve the effectiveness in the delivery of education, Government will prioritise the following actions: -\n\nRoll out the new education curriculum, including Early Childhood Development (ECD) curriculum;\n\nExpand access to Vocational Education and Training, including international accreditation of Business, Technical, and Vocational Education and Training (BTVET) institutions as Centres of Excellence;\n\nImprove the quality of tertiary education institutions by ensuring their adequate staffing and increasing the emphasis on academic research;\n\nEnhance teaching supervision using digital platforms in the inspection of schools through scaling up the Integrated Inspection System; and\n\nDevelop the provision of lessons through digital platforms such as TV, Radios and the Internet to ensure continuous learning and implement the electronic delivery mode in validation and distribution of self-learning materials to learners.\n\nBoosting Economic Transformation\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to boost economic recovery and make progress with our Economic Transformation agenda, the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy we will implement shall(i) Restore Household Incomes and Safeguard Jobs (ii) Re-ignite Business Activity (iii) Provide Tax Relief to Businesses; (iv) Enhance Economic Infrastructure and (v) Improve Good Governance and Maintain Security Law and Order. The specific measures that Government will implement are the following:-\n\nRestoring Household incomes and Safeguarding Jobs\n\nMadam Speaker, following the immediate adverse impact on household incomes and jobs of the emergencies we have recently faced, interventions will be implemented to increase agricultural production to ensure national food security and expand regional food exports. This measure will also sustain the supply of inputs for agro-processing. The restoration of demand for agricultural produce is key to jumpstart this process. Safeguarding Jobs and other non-farm incomes is also critical for the restoration of demand for agricultural products. These actions ultimately ensure the recovery of aggregate demand for domestic products while booting incomes for the majority of households both rural and urban.\n\nThe specific actions that will be implemented in this regard are the following:-\n\nEnhance the provision of improved agricultural inputs using NAADS e-Voucher Scheme to farmers and upscaling agriculture extension services to boost production of key agricultural commodities, for which an allocation of UShs. 300 billion has been made;\n\nCreate jobs for the vulnerable but able bodied persons affected by Corona Virus by expanding labour intensive public works in urban and peri-urban areas; for which an allocation of Ushs 130 billion has been made;\n\nProvide rainwater harvesting technologies in rural communities, implementation of solar irrigation schemes and investment in the construction of multi-purpose water reservoirs\n\nRoll-out regional and community based storage facilities to store increased agricultural products and reduce post-harvest losses; and\n\nProvide seed capital to organised special interest groups under the Youth Fund, Women Entrepreneurship Fund and the \u2018Emyooga\u2019 Talent Support scheme; for which an allocation of UShs. 256 Billion has been made.\n\nRe-Igniting Business Activity\n\nMadam Speaker, Micro, Small and Medium enterprises (MSMEs) are the backbone of Uganda\u2019s economy, representing an estimated 85 percent of private sector companies in regard to employment. The vast majority are operated by households and have also been extremely vulnerable to the recent emergencies, as they have low cash reserves and limited access to affordable investment finance. This also applies to other manufacturing firms that have been unduly affected by the Corona Virus crisis. Restoring their economic activity therefore enhances household incomes, especially in urban areas.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to improve the availability of investment finance and the cash-flows of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and other manufacturing firms, we will implement the following measures: -\n\nProvide credit through SACCOs and Micro Finance Institutions to support micro and small-scale enterprises. I am proposing an allocation of UShs 94 billion for FY2020/21;\n\nIncrease access to credit at Uganda Development Bank to offer low interest financing to manufacturing, agribusiness and other private sector firms, for which I have provided UShs. 1,045 billion over the medium term;\n\nIncrease funding to Uganda Development Corporation for public-private partnership investments to facilitate our import substitution and export promotion strategy, for which I have provided, to start with, UShs. 138 billion;\n\nProvide for Banks to restructure loans to their borrowers who are facing liquidity constraints and provide additional liquidity on a case by case basis, as recently guided by the Bank of Uganda;\n\nReduce charges on mobile banking and mobile money transactions, to improve efficiency, reduce person-to person contact to prevent spread of the Corona Virus; and finally\n\nExpedite the payment of arrears owed by Government to private sector firms commencing July 2020, for which I have provided UShs 673 billion in order to address liquidity constraints faced by suppliers of Government. Priority will be given to Small and Medium Enterprises, cooperative societies and contractors.\n\nTax Relief to Businesses\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to further address the short term emergency liquidity requirements of businesses, boost their cash-flows, and ensure business continuity, I propose the following tax relief measures, which I will in due course present to Parliament:-\n\nDefer payment of Corporate Income Tax or Presumptive tax for Corporations and Small, Medium Enterprises (SMEs). I am deferring until September 2020, the payment of any Corporate Income Tax and Presumptive Tax due 1st April 2020 to 30th June 2020, for tax complaint businesses with a turnover of less than Shs 500 million per annum.\n\nFurthermore, no interest or penalties will accumulate on these amounts during this period. This is aimed to benefit companies and Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs) especially in tourism, manufacturing, horticulture and floriculture. The number of taxpayers benefiting from this measure for whom Corporate Incomes Tax is applicable is 10,140 and the deferred tax is estimated to be Ushs 12.5 billion. In addition, the number of tax payers benefiting from the presumptive tax measure is 23,892, and the deferred tax is estimated to be Ushs 1.38 billion.\n\nDefer payment of PAYE by sectors affected: I am deferring payment until September 2020 of PAYE due from 1st April 2020 to 30th June 2020 for tax compliant Ugandan businesses facing hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. No interest will accumulate on tax due during this period. An estimated UShs 65.35 billion due from Pay As You Earn (PAYE) for manufacturing and tourism sectors is being deferred. For floriculture sector, the expected PAYE deferral is Ushs 0.237 billion.\n\nWaive interest on tax arrears: I am waiving interest and penalties on tax arrears accumulated before 1st July 2020 to lessen the tax liability of businesses who voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. The expected tax relief as a result is Ushs 50 billion.\n\nProvide for Tax Deductibility of Donations for the Corona Virus Response. I am allowing the value of the donations the private sector has made towards the Corona Virus Response.\n\nExpedite Payment of outstanding VAT refunds: The Uganda Revenue Authority will speed up payment of outstanding VAT refunds due to businesses accompanied by measures to limit fraud. An additional Ushs 120.53 billion will be refunded.\n\nFinancial Sector Stability\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to ensure financial sector stability in support of the economy, I reiterate the Bank of Uganda pronouncements on measures being implemented to mitigate risks to overall economic growth, and also ultimately support the financing of businesses:-\n\nProviding for adequate capital buffers for supervised financial institutions to ensure effective operation by deferring payments of all discretionary dividends and bonus payments for at least 90 days effective March 24, 2020. This preserves the capital of a financial institution and is intended to support the real economy;\n\nSmoothening out volatility in the foreign exchange market arising from global financial markets;\n\nProviding exceptional liquidity assistance for a period of up to one year to Supervised Financial Institutions that may need it;\n\nWaiving limitations on restructuring of credit facilities. Supervised Financial Institutions (SFIs) have been permitted to restructure loans and provide loan repayment holidays to companies and individuals affected by the Corona Virus pandemic; and\n\nEncouraging the reduction of Mobile Money and other digital Transactions fees that are charged by Mobile Network Operators and commercial banks, in order to limit the use of cash and customer visits to banks.\n\nEnhance economic infrastructure\n\nMadam Speaker, economic infrastructure covering roads, rail, water, irrigation and air transport remains key to economic recovery and boosting economic transformation. The interventions that will be implemented to enhance economic infrastructure include the following:-\n\nUndertaking emergency maintenance across the country of Roads and Bridges infrastructure following the destruction caused by floods;\n\nDeveloping warehousing capacity at community, district and regional hubs across the country to restoring supply chains and promote exports;\n\nExpediting construction of priority industrial parks and special economic zones;\n\nRehabilitating the Meter Gauge Railway, improving water transport safety by installing navigation aids and development of air cargo infrastructure, including the completion of the new cargo facility at the Entebbe International Airport; and\n\nExpanding feeder and national road network, power, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure.\n\nImproving Peace, Security and Good Governance\n\nMadam Speaker, Government will continue to improve peace and security, the rule of law and good governance. As we have done before, good governance will be enhanced to provide the necessary conducive environment to facilitate all aspects of societal development. The specific measures address (i) the promotion of peace and security at the community and national level; (ii) enhancing effectiveness in public service delivery; and (iii) increasing access to justice.\n\nPeace and Security\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to promote peace and security of persons and property at the community level, we will implement the following measures:\n\nIntensify community vigilance by strengthening the Local Council system, promote community policing in coordination with Local Defence Units (LDUs);\n\nComplete the rollout of the Safe City CCTV project in Jinja, Lugazi, Kayunga, Njeru, Gulu and Masaka and ensure its effective utilization in monitoring crime and responding to distress calls;\n\nImprove border control through phased implementation of border point automation, in order to control illegal entry, improve compliance with immigration laws and regulations, and ensure national security;\n\nstrengthen the capacity of internal security; and\n\nFast track implementation of the convict transitional policy to integrate former convicts back into their communities.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to ensure the defence of the country, Government will further strengthen the capability of the Uganda Peoples\u2019 Defence Forces, and enhance the effectiveness of the Intelligence apparatus.\n\nAccess to Justice\n\nMadam Speaker, to improve access to Justice, the following interventions will be undertaken:-\n\nConstruct an additional 5 one-stop Justice Law and Order Service Centres across the country;\n\nImplement the electronic case management system in the Judiciary to increase efficiency in case management;\n\nDe-concentrate services for Government Analytical laboratories and business registration services to regional centers in Arua, Fort Portal, Gulu, Mbale, Mbarara and Moroto;\n\nBuild capacity of Local Council courts in adjudication in order to decongest courts of petty cases and increase access to justice. To date 38,000 Local Council Court officials have been trained and a further 78,000 are targeted for training in 2020/21;and\n\nEliminate case backlog by implementing the case backlog reduction strategy, including the use of non-custodial sentences including Community Service to reduce remand population.\n\nMadam Speaker, Parliament recently enacted into law the Administration of the Judiciary Bill 2018 which comprehensively provides for the functioning, operation and administrative independence of the Judiciary. Construction of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal has commenced and will eventually address housing of these important appellant courts of law. We therefore look forward for enhanced performance of the Judiciary.\n\nPublic Service Delivery\n\nMadam Speaker, to achieve better public service delivery, the following actions will be undertaken: -\n\nIntegrate systems and implement one-stop Service Uganda centres to allow the public to access related services in a single location. The Service Uganda centres will be rolled out to 18 zonal offices across the country.\n\nDevelop the Public Investment Management Systems (PIMS) policy to strengthen Sector coordination in Project identification, preparation, implementation and ex-post evaluation; define roles and responsibilities of Project stakeholders, enhance project management and institute a culture of maintenance of public assets;\n\nImplement e-Government procurement across all Ministries, Departments, Agencies and Local Governments, and monitor government contracts and procurement in partnership with non-state actors in order to improve efficiency, eliminate corruption in procurement and reduce cost of doing business;\n\nEnhance tele-conferencing facilities in government to limit person to person contacts in addition to reducing on operational costs in terms of travel expenses; and\n\nFully implement the Leadership Code Act including the operationalization of the Leadership Code Tribunal to ensure that the Leadership Code of Conduct is effectively enforced among all Leaders and Public officers.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to address the challenge of corruption, the following measures will be undertaken:-\n\nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of oversight and anti-corruption institutions in identifying areas of risk;\n\nstrengthen implementation and follow-up on audit recommendations;\n\nstrengthen implementation of Public Finance Management rules and regulations and the role of Internal Audit; and\n\nenhance capacity of the Financial Intelligence Authority and related security agencies to intensify surveillance and gather of vital information to curb Anti-money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nFinancing Framework\n\nMadam Speaker, Government is developing an Integrated Financing Strategy to guide and monitor how we appropriately raise domestic revenues, and both domestic and external debt financing over the NDP III period. This strategy lays out how Government shall approprately raise financing to meet its development goals, in both the short and medium term. It will also ensure that Government only borrows at most favourable financing terms for projects that will provide a socio-economic growth dividend.\n\nMadam Speaker, the with respect to the Financing Framework that underpins the Economic Stimulus and Growth Strategy I have elaborated, it specifically balances the need to restore economic activity, on the one hand, while raising adequate revenues to finance government expenditures. The sources for funding include domestic revenues and public debt financing.\n\nDomestic Revenues\n\nMadam Speaker, domestic revenue measures for next financial year are anchored on the Domestic Revenue Mobilization Strategy (DRMS), which aims to mobilise sufficient revenue to support infrastructure development and social welfare. The Strategy balances competing challenges of increasing the revenue effort to support expenditure needs, while at the same time facilitating investment and industrialisation. The Strategy seeks to enhance revenue collection to finance the larger part of our Budget in the short, medium and long term and to create a tax system that is fair and transparent.\n\nMadam Speaker, in view of the recent emergencies we have faced, Government introduced modest adjustments in some taxes to raise revenue. This will support enhanced economic recovery, as well as maintain an acceptable level of social welfare. Tax administration will be strengthened to improve efficiency in revenue collection. The capacity of local governments, including the roll out of the digital collection of fees and rates, will also be enhanced to improve local revenue generation.\n\nMadam Speaker, next financial year's revenue target is UGX 21,810 billion, comprised of tax revenue amounting to UGX 20,219 billion and non-tax revenue of UGX 1,591 billion. This target translates into a revenue effort of 14.3 percent of GDP. To achieve this target, we will implement the following new interventions: -\n\nFurther roll out use of digital tax stamps and expand the range of products covered in order to deter under-declaration of production and importation. Digital stamps also ensure that goods on the market meet the required health and safety standards;\n\nWiden the scope of the income tax withholding agents across all sectors in order to broaden the tax base;\n\nEnhance rental income tax collection and compliance by implementing a digital collection solution, as well as gazette rental income tax chargeable in different geographical areas for taxpayers who do not voluntarily declare their rental income;\n\nGazette VAT withholding agents with an applicable VAT rate of 6 percent, and provide for penalties for failure to withhold; and\n\nRollout the use of Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFDs), which are - cash registers interconnected to the Uganda Revenue Authority, to improve record keeping and tax compliance.\n\nMadam Speaker, the modest adjustments to tax rates that have been made include the excise duty rate on fuel; and adjustments to improve competitiveness in the region, support compliance, remove ambiguities in the legislations as well as close loopholes that may lead to revenue leakage. In order to promote import substitution and the development of local industries, we have increased import duties on goods that are produced or can be produced locally. The import duty on agricultural products has been increased to 60 percent and other products to 35 percent.\n\nHitherto, we have been importing refined industrial sugar yet we are a surplus producer of sugar. We have agreed with sugar manufacturers to produce refined industrial sugar locally and we shall protect them from imports.\n\nMadam Speaker, in order to support agriculture, VAT on the supply of agricultural equipment will be exempted. The supply of processed milk will also be VAT exempt to enhance the price competitiveness of milk produced in Uganda. In order to respond effectively to the covid-19 pandemic, taxes on supplies for diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and management of the epidemics, pandemics and health hazards, will be exempt from customs duties.\n\nPublic Debt Financing\n\nMadam Speaker, total public debt as at December 2019 amounted to United States Dollars 13.3 Billion, with external debt accounting for United States Dollars 8.59 Billion or 64.4 percent while domestic debt amounted to United States Dollars 4.74 Billion or 35.6 percent of total debt stock.\n\nMadam Speaker, Government\u2019s approach to public debt financing is elaborated in the Medium Term Debt Strategy for the five- year period commencing next financial year. The Strategy seeks to contract only affordable external debt in preference to domestic debt. The approach to reduce domestic debt in preference to external debt is intended to lower the cost of interest payments to 2.2 percent of GDP compared to 2.6 percent of GDP, if we were to continue borrowing signficantly from domestic sources.\n\nMadam Speaker, to ensure that public debt remains sustainable, we will implement the Domestic Revenue Mobilization Strategy to increase Government\u2019s capacity to finance programs with less reliance on domestic and external borrowing. In response to the Corona Virus crisis, Government has commenced negotiations with some creditors for debt relief. This will free resources to finance interventions in the fight against the pandemic.\n\nResource Envelope and Allocations for Financial Year 2020/21\n\nMadam Speaker, the Resource Envelope of Financial year 2020/21 totals Shs.45,493.7 Billion of which Domestic Resources amount to Shs. 25,585.6 Billion. Domestic Financing amounts to Shs 3,560.3 Billion; while External Financing consists of Project Support of Shs. 9,515.3 Billion and General Budget Support Shs. 2,906.7 Billion. Domestic re-financing amounts to Shs. 7,486.1 Billion and Appropriation in Aid is Shs. 215.6 Billion.\n\nMadam Speaker, total Expenditure amounts to UShs. 37,792 Billion of which Recurrent Expenditure is UShs. 19,787.8 billion and Development Expenditure is UShs. 18,004.2 Billion. Sector allocations can be found in the Budget as approved by Parliament.\n\nConclusion\n\nMadam Speaker, Uganda\u2019s economic outlook is positive. The Corona Virus pandemic has helped us to once again demonstrate the economic capacity and the vast opportunities that our country has. The budget for Financial Year 2020/21 will support the economy to fully recover, harness the potential that we have, and get back to our progressive journey of double digit GDP growth rate.\n\nThe focus of the budget for next financial year places emphasis on supporting livelihoods and the recovery of business enterprises, without losing focus on our long-term development initiatives. To this end, the Government will support the private sector to scale up production, sustain and increase employment.\n\nI call upon Ugandans to ensure they keep safe by particularly following the directives from His Excellency the President and Ministry of Health regarding CoVID-19. The challenge of CoVID-19 will go, and the economy will pick up once again even at a much higher speed. I therefore implore all Ugandans to be part of this journey and, in the end, enjoy the fruits of our common efforts.\n\nMadam Speaker, the recent emergencies, especially the Corona Virus pandemic have necessitated additional interventions and resource allocations after the Budget was approved. We have since been undertaking extensive consultations with several stakeholders, including civil society and the private sector, on remedial actions. Consequently, the budgets of all Ministries, Agencies and Local Governments will be revised to align them with the nine (9) strategic priorities and 14 production lines articulated by His Excellency, the President. This will focus the budget on production and not consumption. I will accordingly return to Parliament for the necessary approval.\n\nI beg to submit.\n\nFor God and My Country.", "link": "https://observer.ug/news/headlines/65229-shs-45-trillion-budget-speech", "published": "2020-06-11T15:13:42+03:00"}, {"title": "Woman awarded Shs 282m after police auctioned her car for Shs 1m", "author": ["Derrick Kiyonga", "Michael Wakabi", "Wadada Rogers"], "text": "A police officer has been ordered by the High court to pay Shs 50 million as part of the total Shs 282 million compensation awarded to Adrine Kemirembe after police illegally auctioned off her missing car.\n\nJustice Lydia Mugambe awarded Kemirembe Shs 120m for loss of income and Shs 150m in general damages - all to be paid by the government, and another Shs 50m to be paid Anatoli Muleterwa, then community liaison officer at the central police station (CPS) Kampala or be committed to prison.\n\nIt all started on November 14, 2008, when a Nissan Datsun pickup, registration number; UAE 130H belonging to Kemirembe went missing from Makerere University main library parking lot. At the time the car went missing, it was being driven by Kemirembe's husband, Alex Ssebagala who was working on his dissertation at the university library.\n\nOn the same day, Ssebagala reported a case of a missing vehicle; SD REF 28/14/1108 at Makerere University police post and at Kampala central police station under reference No. ERU/999/CPSSD REF 15/29/12/0.\n\nThere was no report from the police about the progress of the search. But as fate would have it, two years later, court heard that on April 26, 2010, while in Kisenyi a Kampala a suburb, Kemirembe's husband saw the missing vehicle used for business. Ssebagala then hired the vehicle up to Makerere University police station where the driver and turnboy were arrested.\n\nUpon interrogation, the driver, Jamil Mutyaba told police that the car belonged to Muleterwa, who was then the community liaison officer for Kampala Metropolitan Area. Court heard that the vehicle had been sold to Muleterwa's wife, Margaret Kizza at Shs 1 million through auction. When confronted, Muleterwa asked Kemirembe to pay back the Shs 1 million that his wife paid for the car.\n\nMuleterwa, nowthe head of community policing department, told the court that the auctioning was legal since there was a court order, authorizing the auction after the custodian of exhibits at central police station complained that they were congesting the police station.\n\nHead of community policing department, ACP Anatoli Muleterwa at his desk recently\n\nHowever, in her judgement, justice Mugambe said that she failed to understand under what circumstances a missing car that had been reported to police, was auctioned and how it had reached the central police station.\n\n\"Needless to say, the close relationship of wife and husband between DW1 [Muleterwa] and Kizza Margaret who bought the car demonstrates a conflict of interest in DW1\u2019s dealings in relation to this car...However more striking is the contradiction of DW1\u2019s [Muleterwa] testimony when I look at the list of items the court authorized sale of and the list of items the auctioneer DW2 put up for sale.

The judge said it was clear and easy to infer that Muleterwa's hand was behind the grand scheme to illegally sell off Kemirembe's car.\n\n\"It's near to blasphemy that Muleterwa could stand in court on oath before me and insist that the sale of the plaintiff's car was authorized by court whereas not. If he would lie in this aspect, one wonders which part of his testimony is truthful\", Mugambe added.\n\nThe judge further said that Muleterwa was fully aware of the search operation for the lost car at the material time, yet he grossly involved in its misappropriation when it was sold to his wife illegally.\n\nKemirembe had calculated loss of income at Shs 50,000 per day for six days - translating to Shs 157 million but Mugambe reduced this to Shs 120m, saying the car couldn\u2019t have been bringing full daily income for all the six days of every week and through the years. She said some days would be unprofitable and it would have worn off and the days of earning income would have reduced through the years.\n\nCourt also awarded Kemirembe Shs 12m in recovery as the total value for her vehicle.

She explained that Ndegwa sanctioned the donation as part of the company's social corporate responsibility and an effort to gain business from government over their rivals Medishell, which had already donated another medical equipment.\n\nHowever, the company denied sanctioning the donation, saying it was only discovered while scrutinising the company documents following Komujuni\u2019s resignation.

The closure, which came at a time when the economy was bleeding from all kinds of stresses, has come with a price, although the country has been praised for keeping its virus caseload down.\n\nAs a result of the lockdown, many businesses have closed shop while some have instituted stringent cost-cutting measures such as job layoffs. Things were expected to be different. Uganda\u2019s government was expected to spend heavily on infrastructure projects such as roads and power plants, a marketing tool ahead of the 2021 general elections. Many of those plans were shelved.\n\nStandard bank also thought the final investment decision (FID) for the oil projects would be made this year. The oil companies operating in the upstream sector were expected to sign a $3.5 billion investment decision for the crude oil pipeline between Hoima and Tanga in Tanzania.\n\nBut now, according to Standard bank, \u201cdue to the pandemic, which has now made it impossible for expatriates working in the oil fields to travel, the FID will probably have to be postponed into second half of 2021. The international oil price plummet too will now serve as a disincentive for oil firms to finalize the FID.\u201d\n\nThe bank is also worried that \u201celection-related anxiety prompts firms to postpone investment decisions, while household consumption also becomes restrained.\u201d\n\nStandard bank says the amount of money Uganda will receive from exports compared to what it will spend on imports will be lower.\n\n\u201cWe see the current account deficit widening to 8.2 per cent of GDP in 2020. Owing to Covid-19, tourism receipts will probably decline further in 2020. In fact, tourist arrivals and earnings were faltering for much of 2019 due to the border closure with Rwanda\u2026 \u201d\n\nStill reinforcing its point around tourism receipts, the report noted that \u201cregardless, even if cross-border travel was to resume in the second half of 2020, tourism won\u2019t recover then. Furthermore, with elections expected to be held in February 2021, tourist arrivals would anyway be only a trickle due to greater political risks around that time.\u201d\n\nWith tourism, Uganda\u2019s main export earner, faltering, gold remains one the best fall-back position for the country. The report notes that Uganda\u2019s gold exports rapidly shot up to $1.3 billion in 2019, from $515 million in 2018 and $417.9 million in 2017. But the report notes a big problem with gold trade, pointing to the issue around smuggling.\n\n\u201cIf increased safe haven demand continues to support gold prices, goods exports could be underpinned over the coming year. But FX [foreign exchange] earnings from gold receipts are barely passed via the domestic interbank market,\u201d the report says.\n\nA lot of the gold from Uganda is suspected to come from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\njeff@observer.ug", "link": "https://observer.ug/businessnews/65203-standard-bank-predicts-tough-future-for-uganda-s-economy", "published": "2020-06-12T21:39:15+03:00"}, {"title": "Business leaders call for more digital platforms", "author": ["Rose Mugena"], "text": "Business experts believe that using digital platforms to transact during this time of the coronavirus pandemic is the best way of growing sales revenues.\n\nSpeaking during the fifth edition of the Innovation Series event by brainchildBCW, an affiliate of Burson Cohn & Wolfe, Africa\u2019s largest PR network, Walter Wafula the Business Unit head at brainchildBCW, said: \u201cAs the unexpected costs and losses of Covid-19 to businesses mount, the need for practical, scalable, quick and effective solutions is urgent.

He added: \u201cAfrica will have about 700 million mobile users in the next two years; this goes ahead to show the great shift to digital payments for the masses.\u201d\n\nRicky Rapa, the co-founder of SafeBoda Holdings, advised government to think of public transport.\n\n\u201cThe government recently eased public transportation with strict regulations including half-capacity seating to prevent the spread of the virus. Payment methods for this should also be addressed to reduce the physical cash transactions between passenger and drivers and embracing new digital payments through contactless cards such as VISA, mobile money and cashless rides, among others, should be at the forefront especially in the transport business.\u201d\n\nIn other related news, DStv and GOtv customers are set to have online access to purchase a range of kit items and have them delivered at the location of their preference while they stay safe at home. This after MultiChoice Uganda and Jumia signed a partnership to allow these kinds of transactions.\n\nWhile announcing the partnership, Colin Asiimwe, MultiChoice Uganda head of marketing said the partnership between the two firms is timely in light of the need to minimize physical contact in light of the current Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe partnership is driven by the increase in the uptake of digital services influenced by existing and new technologies supported by better internet services thus revolutionizing how individuals and businesses operate.

This has seen more businesses become cloud-enabled, offer flexibility to their workforces as well as adopt digital systems to support their work.\n\nIn a webinar that was held recently, Dennis Musinguzi the senior manager, products and services at MTN Uganda says that although businesses suffered a lot at the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown, they have ensured their continuity by going digital and serving their customers through digital channels.\n\n\u201cFresh food markets suffered the most during lockdown. However, they went digital and started doing home deliveries. They are now in business,\u201d Musinguzi said.\n\nChristopher Ssali, the acting general manager mobile financial services at MTN Liberia noted that there has been an observed change in the payment habits over the last months as people are opting for contactless payment options more than before.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 brings a new opportunity; previously more people felt more secure with cash. But after the pandemic, more people feel secure with payment options such as mobile money,\u201d Ssali said, noting that mobile money is a new safer currency for payment of both goods and services and more people are appreciating mobile money as a new currency.\n\nSsali further noted that the paradigm shift in the forms of payment has led to a mobile money evolution and as such, significantly reduce the need to use cash in the value chain.\n\nIn resonance with Ssali, Stone Atwine, the chief executive officer of Eversend noted that the increase in mobile money usage has kept businesses afloat by enabling them to transact during the pandemic. Borrowing credence from his company, Atwine said that companies should embrace new operational models in order to survive the adverse effects of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to do things that have not been done yet.

The rapid spread of the virus has posed massive health and economic challenges to everyone.\n\nHowever, there have been several measures that have been implemented by the Government of Uganda to prevent the spread of Covid-19, leading to a shutdown of many of the economic activities in both domestic and international trade, such as closure of the international airport except for cargo, mandatory closure of non-essential businesses, compulsory stay at home of non-essential workers, among others.\n\nMore importantly, the greatest economic brunt of Covid-19 will be borne by the poor and low-income-earning segment of our population.\n\nTherefore, the government\u2019s primary focus should be on providing income support, especially to the underprivileged segments such as daily wage workers, labourers, and the like.\n\nFor the taxpaying population, the government needs to boost household consumption expenditure to boost demand, for which tax measures that incentivize savings may be needed. Among businesses, the small and medium enterprises segment (SMEs) would be the hardest hit. This sector is also important from the perspective of job creation and retention of the existing jobs in this period.\n\nEmploying 80 per cent of employees in the private sector and contributing 20 per cent to the nation\u2019s GDP, this sector is a force to reckon with.\n\nAccordingly, there should be an attempt to identify creative ways to mobilize additional tax and non-tax revenue, without in anyway burdening the taxpayers.\n\nAs government looks to make up for the shortfall in revenue, it may, in desperation, turn to excessive taxation which may have adverse effects to companies, including some going bankrupt. This is akin to killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. So, to ensure that long-term revenue does not suffer due to short-term considerations, taxpayer welfare is important.\n\nThe government has already announced certain tax relief measures such as extension of filing return dates. However, a crisis like this calls for bigger tax measures that can form part of the larger economic impetus, which government may provide to bring the economy back on track. The following measures may be considered on a short-term basis, say three to six months to enable the taxpayer withstand uncertainty in the economy.\n\n1. The taxpayers can file tax returns within due date and there will be an option of paying the self-assessment tax after six months of filing the return.\n\n2. Company profits are likely to significantly suffer, at least in the first two quarter of this fiscal year. Further owing to the prevailing economic uncertainty, companies are likely to find it extremely difficult to estimate their tax liability in the first two quarters of FY 2020/2021 hence government should waive the 20 per cent under provisioning penalty during FY 2020/21.\n\n3. Advance tax payment schedule may be rationalised to mandate a payment of only 25 per cent of total taxes until December 2020 without payment of interest.\n\n4. The application of rates of interest on delayed payment of advance or unpaid taxes could be lowered say to 0.5 per cent per month from the existing 2 per cent or suspend interest on late payments for the first 6 months of FY 2020-21.\n\n5. As a one-off measure, the option of providing reduced corporate tax rates to companies may be explored. This can be proposed only for the corporates which have suffered a reduced turnover beyond a threshold (say 25 per cent to-30 per cent) during the FY 2020-21. Certain conditions may be attached to avail the same, such as no reduction in number of employees, no re-constriction of business by way of merger/de-merger, slump sale. Such incentives will aid the travel and tourism industry, which have been hard hit by the pandemic.\n\n6. Short-term capital loss made by retail investors due recent stock market slump should be allowed to be set off from employment taxable income.\n\n7. Value Added Tax (VAT) credits carry forward threshold could be increased from the current Shs 5 million to Shs 50 million. This will ease pressure on businesses as many would be exempted from the tax audit requirement for the current fiscal year.\n\n8. Donations to Covid-19 National task Force should be allowed as a deduction over the next few years (say, within a span of three years) instead of just FY 2020-2021.\n\n9. Suspension of tax debt recovery during Financial Year 2020/ 21. Tax administration may want to consider suspension of debt recovery, including suspension of the garnishing of bank accounts through URA\u2019s use of agency notices, asset seizures and sales.\n\nAbove all, it is pertinent to remember that the current situation is unprecedented in the history of mankind and, therefore, the above measures described give ideas on the best efforts to emulate in our country to suit our domestic settings. Also, international cooperation may be sought to analyse the best tax policy measures to update our policies to counter the economic crisis precipitated by Covid-19.\n\nmoses.b.wasswa@ug.ey.com\n\nThe author is a tax manager at Ernst & Young Certified Public Accountants of Uganda.", "link": "https://observer.ug/businessnews/65201-tax-relief-measures-in-response-to-covid-19", "published": "2020-06-11T01:06:12+03:00"}, {"title": "Airtel marks 10-year milestone", "author": ["Our Reporter"], "text": "Airtel Uganda celebrated 10 years in Uganda on June 8, with its subscriber numbers exploding to 10 million from the 2.5 million it inherited from Zain.\n\nSpeaking during the announcement of the 10-year anniversary celebrations, V.G Somasekhar, the Airtel Uganda managing director, in a statement, said: \u201cAs a subsidiary of Airtel Africa Limited, we look at ourselves as a proudly Ugandan company here to uphold our promise to connect and enable millions of Ugandans.\n\nOur journey began with a commitment to provide the people of Uganda access to quality and affordable mobile telecommunications services.

I loved the song so much because of its great energy and vibe. [The TV and radio host describes himself as an MC, event organizer, fashionista, motivational speaker, actor and a father.]\n\n\n\nIs television something you always wanted to do?\n\nNo, I actually wanted to be a doctor, but unfortunately I lost my parents at an early age and I used to be in and out of school, missed a lot of classes and I lost that dream.\n\n\n\nWhat has been the highlight of your career so far?\n\nMe getting a job at NTV, because that was my dream.\n\nYou have started singing as well\u2026[his song, Kyoyina Omanya, is a relative hit]\n\nI am a very versatile person and I feel that in Uganda for you to be rich, you do not have to depend on one thing. I also wanted to benefit from these artistes because I always play their music on my shows and now they give me collabos for free.\n\n\n\nWhat are you more passionate about, media or music?\n\nI must say I am more passionate about TV. Most people have known me because of TV and it is what has made me; so, I cannot quit TV for music.\n\n\n\nSheila Gashumba recently said you guys earn Shs 50,000 per hour on air\n\nYeah, we are not paid what we are worth, but I cannot blame the media houses because no one is really paid what they want. We all want more but what matters is how you use the little you are paid. If a company is paying you Shs 50,000 like she said but they see you in clubs buying alcohol of Shs 600,000, how do you expect them to add you more money?\n\nSo, you are satisfied with your ka 50k?\n\nHonestly, I am paid more than 50k, because I am probably alone on the show, but I cannot say I am satisfied because there is really never enough money.\n\n\n\n#NTVDanceParty and #NBSSNL; how do you find the competition?\n\nIt is healthy and there is nothing like bad blood between us. They even play my music on the shows the other side and during or after the shows we talk. Some fans have that negativity that we cannot have a healthy competition, which should not be the case.\n\n\n\nIs it even necessary?\n\nIt is working for everyone. My following and fan base has tremendously grown during this period and so has it for everyone else on the show and that means that the engagement and impact the shows have is really good. That is why I think the government should have even stopped people from paying for TV subscription so that they enjoy fully, because we are doing these shows to relieve the stress.\n\n\n\nLately you call yourself the \u201cKing of the Mic\u201d, a title associated with MC Kats.\n\nYes, I am calling myself the King of the Mic, but that doesn\u2019t mean that MC Kats is not. He is a king in his own way and I am also a king in my own way. MC Kats is a legend and I respect him so much because many MCs look up to him.\n\nI am a guy who believes so much in myself and when I say I am the King of the Mic, it is no disrespect to anyone. If you feel you are better than me, I am ready for a battle.\n\n\n\nDo I hear a dare for MC Kats?\n\nIf he wants to and he is okay with it, then we get on the stage. Like I told you earlier, I believe in healthy competition. If he is ready, I got my energy ready. [Over to you, MC Kats!]\n\n\n\nThose are some big guts you got right there! Who do you look up to?\n\nIn Uganda, I don\u2019t have anybody I look up to. I look up to only one guy Crysto Panda, because I have my own vibe. Outside Uganda, I look up to Nick Canon, because he does everything I do from music, to TV shows and hosting events.\n\n\n\nYour other show, T-Nation is mainly based on schools, which are now closed. Isn\u2019t that a big challenge?\n\nNo, the good thing is that I had canned my events so that I could air them later. Another thing is that the show is not only about schools, but entertainment as well. There is music, movies and I have been skyping different celebrities to talk to my viewers.\n\n\n\nYou host a teens\u2019 show yet are no teenager...\n\nPeople have said that, but I want them to understand something; presenting is not about the age, but how you fit in. There are very many young people who have come here to do the show but they have all failed. I have no problem leaving the show, but my bosses feel I am still good for the show. Even if I leave T-Nation, I will still be in schools, because that\u2019s my life. I will be organizing events and proms and put them on my YouTube channel.\n\n\n\nYou wanted to join NTV The Beat; what went wrong?\n\nMunnange, my bosses and sponsors of the show by then told me not to leave because when making sponsorship deals, the presenter is signed as well; so, removing him or her costs the company and that is why I had to remain on T-Nation.\n\n\n\nCongs on your new baby! How does it feel to be a first-time dad?\n\nIt feels good. Though at first some people told me I was going to lose fans because of having a baby, but I believe people want a responsible person. I am a proud father. I have been so open about it and that is why I post her pictures every time.\n\n\n\nWhat went through your mind when you heard, \u201cI am pregnant\u201d?\n\nI was so happy, because I really wanted it. It is good to have a child when you are still youthful so that you can have much time with them, because you can never know when life ends. I want to be there for my child and take care of her not like my dad who abandoned my mum and didn\u2019t take care of us.\n\nShould we listen for the wedding bells?", "link": "https://observer.ug/lifestyle/65194-crysto-panda-dares-mc-kats-to-a-mic-battle", "published": "2020-06-12T22:14:12+03:00"}, {"title": "Sex talk: Here\u2019s how to keep the good times coming", "author": ["Carolyne Nakazibwe", "Julian Mukiibi"], "text": "Rebecca Gupta a family law attorney, who has been married 16 years to American neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta, says one of the first signs of trouble in marriages/divorces is resentment.\n\nFestering resentment will be the straw that breaks your camel\u2019s back, especially if you don\u2019t know how to express gratitude and respect for your spouse\u2019s hustle; be that hustle in bed, the kitchen, boardroom or the market.\n\nThe Guptas are part of 40 celebrity couples interviewed by Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue for their 40th marriage anniversary book, What Makes A Marriage Last released in May 2020.\n\nBy the way, it is a really good book.

Without even realising it, you become resentful and one day you just might explode.\n\nInstead of secretly rolling your eyes in mockery as clueless, he twists his back this way-that way, speak up and effect changes before the thought of making love becomes altogether revolting.\n\nInstead of pretending that you are okay with her lacklustre approach to sex, have a state of the union address before it is too late. Others never truly show gratitude in words or otherwise. Not for the hot sex they just had, not for a great meal they just got served, not for the humble financial contribution their spouse delivers. Everything is met with silence or complaints.\n\nYou are sowing resentment. The day your spouse ups and does something ridiculous, don\u2019t look too far for answers. I believe I am a good cook, but those who know me also know I don\u2019t particularly derive any enjoyment from the kitchen gymnastics like many people do. Because of that, I show extra gratitude to people who feed me, instead of constantly grumbling about the stones in the rice, gauging the chapatti\u2019s weight and roundness, counting the beans!\n\nBut many spouses who have neither time nor skill for the kitchen dish out only criticism and rudeness. When your spouse stays at home to take care of that turf and the children, stop disrespecting him or her, just because your hustle is in a boardroom. Keeping the home running like clockwork is hard work too! If you don\u2019t get it, you will encourage your spouse to disengage all effort.\n\nThank your spouse for kameeza money before waving the \u2018small\u2019 notes disdainfully with \u201cwhat am I supposed to do with this!\u201d Well, you didn\u2019t have it in your own purse, for starters...\n\nAnd by all means, stop taking and taking and taking during sex, then rolling away with a grunt afterwards like the family rooster. It is a gesture of gratitude to offer to bring your spouse to their own climax afterwards using other methods \u2013 assuming you even notice that you are not on the same page. Everyone could use some oxytocin!\n\nIt is also good grooming and sexy to say things like \u201cthat was awesome\u201d, \u201cI so loved that\u201d, or even \u201cI love you\u201d... There are a thousand ways to express gratitude after sex even without the words \u2018thank you\u2019. Just show some appreciation, somehow.\n\nI have written before about the Ugandan wife who said that once, when her husband of 13 years hit all the right notes and spots, she literally, spontaneously tipped him. The husband confirmed this and said to date, he guards that tip money fiercely and cannot spend it regardless how broke he gets, because it symbolizes an intimate, sexy memory for him.\n\nGratefulness is part of sex etiquette \u2013 heck, polished men even show gratitude when their wives give birth to their babies; besides, showing your appreciation after lovemaking is necessary to keep the good things coming and keep resentment away. Just like in everything else.\n\ncarol@observer.ug", "link": "https://observer.ug/lifestyle/65193-sex-talk-here-s-how-to-keep-the-good-times-coming", "published": "2020-06-11T00:48:56+03:00"}, {"title": "Three is a crowd: David did not sleep with Julie; he lived with her!", "author": ["Margaret Wamanga"], "text": "David and Diane have been married for years; then there is Julie, the young secretary whose axis collides with the couple\u2019s in ways none of them saw coming.\n\n\n\nDIANE\n\nMy main reason for not joining David and the kids on the day\u2019s outing was that I was still dealing with all the emotions that had come with David\u2019s confirmation of his affair; I was slowly realizing that while I had forgiven him in my mind, my still-badly-bruised heart was yet to follow suit.\n\nBesides, after a week away, there were tasks I wanted the maid to get started on as soon as she returned, and I would rather be there in person to supervise those.\n\nOnce David and the kids had left, I began putting away the breakfast things, while making a mental list of these tasks. There was a visible layer of dust on most surfaces; there was the laundry. And then it struck me; the maid had been gone for a week, but I had not seen any dirty clothes of David\u2019s accumulated over that week!\n\nLeaving the kitchen, I rushed back upstairs and a quick look around the bedroom and bathroom confirmed there were no dirty clothes. Someone had been doing David\u2019s laundry, and I immediately knew who that someone was.\n\nNext, I noticed what I had missed when I looked through the wardrobe, when I first got back: some of David\u2019s clothes were missing. My heart stopped, then sank, as I realized that while I had been going through hell at my parents\u2019 house, David had been living with that woman. No wonder he had not called!\n\nSuddenly his confession, apology, and promises that it was over meant nothing, for he had not just slept with her; he had lived with her. I sank to the floor, overcome with a flood of emotions ranging from rage to hurt to helplessness, as I came to the acknowledgement that my marriage - as I knew it - was over.\n\nThe only question that remained was, what was I going to do about it?\n\nDAVID\n\nThe children had a great time at the waterpark and it was a pleasure to watch them. I had thought I would get stressed looking after the three of them by myself, but to my surprise, I was actually finding the outing rather relaxing.\n\nIt was refreshing to get away from everything else going on in my life, and just be surrounded by the sound of running water, and children\u2019s happy laughter.\n\nDiane\u2019s strange behaviour that morning made me feel like there was something lurking just beneath the surface, like the rumble of thunder before a storm; so, although I had not been thrilled about her choosing not to come, it was actually nice to get away from those vibes for a few hours.\n\nThe only thing that shook me was when during a break from the water to have lunch, Daniel asked if Diane and I were going to get a divorce.\n\n\u201cOf course not! Where on earth did you get that idea?\u201d I asked, in complete shock.\n\n\u201cI told my friend that we were staying at Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s house with mum, and he said that when his parents got a divorce, his mum had taken him and his brothers to his grandparents; house as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were only visiting your grandparents; your mother and I are not getting a divorce!\u201d I answered firmly. \u201cGood. I want you and mum to stay married forever,\u201d he replied seriously.\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d I promised, then repeated it more firmly: \u201cWe will.\u201d\n\nConsidering my concerns about Diane\u2019s behaviour, I probably should not have sounded as confident as I did, but looking into my son\u2019s eyes, and seeing the mixture of worry and hope there, I knew that no matter what it took, I would keep my promise to him.\n\nJULIE\n\nAfter my mother had raised the subject of David again, the visit grew uncomfortable, and as soon as it was reasonably acceptable for me to leave, I did.\n\nI, however, still did not want to spend the day alone in the flat; so, I got off the taxi at a popular upscale mall, planning to while away some time browsing through the shops.\n\nIt was a spontaneous decision and totally out of character for me; the mall was not the sort of place that I normally go to. Even after David had come into my life and \u2018upgraded\u2019 me, my personal spending habits had not really changed. Most of the money he gave me went to my siblings and mother, and since he did a lot of the house shopping, I did not spend money on that either.\n\nEver since I had started working, my needs and wants always came last on my budget list, and I was usually out of money before I got to them; I could now certainly afford to spend money on myself in a place like the mall, and yet I never had. Perhaps it was time to change that.\n\nIt is true that old habits die hard, but surely David had not invested so much in me only for me to stay the same, I told myself as I walked into the mall.\n\nAt first, I felt awkward and out of place in the sprawling space, and for a split second, I considered turning around and leaving, but then I pulled myself together.\n\nI was not an intruder, this was now part of my world, and it was time to embrace it, I chided myself, and then with a bit more confidence, headed for a clothes store on the ground floor with large signs advertising mega sales.\n\nmargaretwamanga@yahoo.com", "link": "https://observer.ug/lifestyle/65192-david-did-not-sleep-with-julie-he-lived-with-her", "published": "2020-06-10T13:30:53+03:00"}, {"title": "Great soup!

Is it actually warranted?\n\nA Warner Bros. executive recently confirmed what some of us have known for years: the Snyder Cut does not exist and it might take an estimated $70m to make his movie.\n\nWe need to discuss the excitement, specifically the fact that it is probably premature. Joss Whedon\u2019s Justice League was a miracle, but the final product was hardly his best work.\n\nFor many fans, Whedon ended on a whimper what Snyder had started with a bang. They were convinced only Snyder\u2019s version could fulfill the promise the director made in Man of Steel.\n\nBut I think people give Snyder too much credit. First of all, I love Zack Snyder. 300 blew my teenage mind and I\u2019m probably one of 10 people that liked Sucker Punch.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned Man of Steel is one of the greatest comic book movies Hollywood has ever produced. And I cannot wait for the Snyder Cut because I know it will provide the only sensible conclusion to this trilogy.\n\nWhedon\u2019s Justice League failed. It was foolish of WB to follow Man of Steel with Batman Vs Superman instead of Man of Steel 2. But once Snyder committed to that particular path, it became clear the events of BVS were funneling the story towards a showdown that would bring the Justice League into the limelight whilst also introducing DC\u2019s biggest villain to moviegoers.\n\nThis is the only reason why I am excited to watch the Snyder Cut. I know that it will give the trilogy a cohesive storyline. However, I would be lying if I said that I was not worried. Does anyone remember BVS? Do any of you remember how hyped we got after that first trailer dropped? How about the tidal wave of anticipation that continued to buffet the nerd community in the months, weeks, and days leading up to the film\u2019s premiere?\n\nDo you remember how elated we all became when we learned that WB executives had seen BVS and given it a standing ovation? We were convinced that BVS could not fail \u2013 a project combining the star power of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman was unstoppable.\n\nThen we saw the movie and\u2026well, you know what happened. It was horrible. And that is where my worry comes from. BVS was Snyder\u2019s baby; the one movie he made as he saw fit, free of restrictions, and it was garbage.\n\nWhat makes people so sure that Snyder\u2019s original version of the Justice League was any better? Admittedly, with the benefit of hindsight, Snyder has the opportunity to fix his mistakes, rework his vision, fine-tune his ideas. But I also think that we should lower our expectations.\n\nkatmic200@gmail.com", "link": "https://observer.ug/lifestyle/65198-snyder-s-justice-league-could-be-garbage-too", "published": "2020-06-10T13:02:41+03:00"}, {"title": "Suicide Squad won\u2019t get a new cut", "author": ["Michael Kateregga", "Daniel Mcauley"], "text": "This is ridiculous. Now that Warner Bros. has given Zack Snyder the greenlight to finish his Justice League cut, DC fans have started petitioning the studio to do the same for David Ayer.\n\nAyer wrote and directed Suicide Squad, a movie that was just as divisive as every other DC Extended Universe (DCEU) film that came before.\n\nAyer\u2019s case does not quite mirror the Snyder Cut. Snyder\u2019s problems began when he produced a version of Justice League that failed to impress WB Executives. They told him to retool the entire movie, but a family tragedy forced him to leave the project, paving the way for Joss Whedon to take over.\n\nAyer, on the other hand, made the movie he wanted and Warner Bros. gave him all the support he needed to bring his vision of Suicide Squad to fruition.\n\nThen the Suicide Squad trailers dropped and anticipation for the movie spiked. WB thought Ayer\u2019s movie was a guaranteed hit. But then Batman Vs Superman (BVS) debuted and the studio\u2019s plans collapsed. WB went into panic mode. Because the Suicide Squad trailers had received such a positive reaction, the studio hired the company that made them and tasked them with editing Ayer\u2019s footage.\n\nAyer was, for lack of a better term, ejected from the final stage of Suicide Squad\u2019s production. Warner Bros. took his movie and left it in the hands of a team best known for making music videos.\n\nLike BVS, Suicide Squad was a disaster. This response, the second failure in the same year, compelled WB to reject Snyder\u2019s Cut months later, unleashing the avalanche of discontentment and disappointment for which the DCEU is known today.\n\nAyer has apologized for his movie. He has also admitted that he had little control over the final product. But now critics want WB to give Ayer \u2018the Snyder treatment\u2019; to give him room to edit and release his version.\n\nBut is any of that necessary? I enjoyed Suicide Squad when I watched it. After the snooze fest that was BVS, Suicide Squad felt like a breath of fresh air.\n\nHowever, it has so many flaws. The idea of assembling a team of human fighters to combat supernatural threats felt dumb. The movie failed to give its characters depth. The Joker, who should have been the central villain, was an afterthought.\n\nMost people agree that Suicide Squad wasted its potential, including Ayer. And I think Ayer knows a new edit of the movie won\u2019t make it any better.\n\nThe core concept won\u2019t change and neither will the story beats nor direction. We don\u2019t need an \u2018Ayer Cut\u2019. At best, it will make marginal improvements; at worst, it will magnify all the movie\u2019s flaws. They should spend that money on making a second Man of Steel.

They believed that the show\u2019s dark subject matter would trigger the worst reactions in suicidal teens that watched its first season.\n\nSome people went so far as to call for the show\u2019s cancellation.

The passport is also is symbolic for exposure, sophistication and a little wealth. [This may not apply for university students, and labour migrants to the Middle East].\n\nThe joke seems to suggest that it is agreeable to die of Covid-19 after having travelled abroad \u2013 where the disease came from. For one would be dying from own sins and pleasures. The joke then runs off suggesting how terribly painful it would be dying from other people\u2019s sins. This is the simpler, and most accessible meaning of the joke. The humour is mild, and grim.\n\nThe complex, and perhaps less accessible part of the joke is that Covid-19 is a bourgeoisies disease. This is not about its origins \u2013 carried by wealthy travellers \u2013 nor that it only affects the wealthy. The bourgeoise nature of Covid-19 is visible in the ways in which especially African governments have responded by privileging those with power and money, not the disease itself.\n\nLet\u2019s start from the beginning: the claim that Covid-19 is an \u201cequaliser disease\u201d has been thoroughly debunked. While global measures in response to the disease, especially the lockdowns stopped Africa\u2019s corrupt elite \u2013 who have ignored building sound health and other infrastructures at home \u2013 from travelling abroad for medical reasons, it affects these potbellied honchos not in the same way it affects the poor.\n\nThere is no doubt it kills indiscriminately and has inflicted the same amount of panic across class lines. But within the same space, the corrupt elite have remained privileged and mildly inconvenienced by the pandemic.\n\nTake for example, while the rich would be able to procure more dry portions for the house, and ably work at home on their laptops, majority of Africa\u2019s labouring adults never have enough saving to last one week, and neither does the concept \u201cworking at home\u201d apply to their reality. This point has been well articulated.\n\nThe related claim that Covid-19 dehumanises the urban poor more has also been succinctly explored. In Uganda, it started by lockdown food supplies being branded \u201cfor the vulnerable poor!\u201d The indignity of such a label was in the fact it meant to underscore a condition of self-imposed laziness and stupidity.\n\nSadly, however, it actually referred to Ugandans who the state had ordered to stay home for the common good of everybody. Indeed, neither of the people referenced as \u201cvulnerable poor\u201d would have agreed to stay home and wait for relief supplies if it were not for the fear of lockdown enforcement. [The crimes of the LDUs have been thoroughly documented].\n\nInterestingly, the label \u201cvulnerable poor\u201d quickly moved from simply being an innocent insult, to a phrase that effectively stigmatised relief supplies. It became a thing of ridicule demanding or even picking relief supplies. And since capitalism creates \u201cperformative identities,\u201d that is, one has to have a good \u201cpublic appearance\u201d that hides the pains of their private lives, demanding for relief food became an embarrassment that risked denting one\u2019s identity.\n\nThis explains why helpful relief efforts \u2013 such as Council Isaac Ssemakadde\u2019s assistance to lawyers or Sadab Kitatta\u2019s to journalists \u2013 insisted in complete anonymity of recipients.\n\nThe most deceptive and certainly most dangerous part of the bourgeois nature of Covid-19 is in its language, and the ways in which the disease was captured in discourse.\n\nTake, for example, the categories, essentials and non-essential. Capitalist exploitation tends to reproduce itself through language and discourse. Capitalism will define our modes of expression, which effectively define social interaction and reflexes to phenomena \u2013 as the common sense.\n\nBy creating terms such as essentials and non-essentials, big money sought to reproduce, but also protect itself. Let\u2019s ask: Did being \u201cessential\u201d actually mean absolutely necessary that the world would end without them? Medical doctors, security personnel, truck drivers, senior government persons, etcetera.\n\nWhile it was easy defining the non-essentials (Covid-19 made everybody a non-essential), it was rather complex defining the essentials list: Journalists had to fight for their lives to make it to the list, lawyers would be limited to just 30, and only late on.\n\nReligious institutions, despite several pleas, would not be added. [Interestingly, bars and strip-tease clubs made it to the list in America, way before religious institutions]. In truth neither of those persons or services defined as \u201cessentials\u201d had any justification to make it to that exclusive list if it were not for the interests of big money and power.\n\nIf Ben Kavuya and family \u201cspecial clearance\u2019 to return to Uganda \u2013 from the United States, the epicentre of the epidemic \u2013 would teach us anything, it is that defining \u201cessentials\u201d went down to big money.\n\nCleared to return on a special chattered passenger plane, Kavuya was also cleared to quarantine in luxury \u2013 Legacy Courts, Bugolobi. He would not be condemned to the blighted prison-like hostels that our friend, Jimmy Spire Ssentongo, and several others have had to endure.\n\nAnd of course, big money needs its doctors, its cargo drivers, and the security personnel to protect them from the marauding non-essentials. There factories had to remain functional.

The Baganda talk of a proverbial hoodwinking cow that sleeps near the fireplace. When you hear it breathe, you think it is blowing into the fire. That is the African Union.\n\nSo last week, its chairman, Moussa Faki Mahamat, felt urgent need to add his voice to the unfortunate event of an American white policeman killing black George Floyd on the street. The message was that he \u201cstrongly condemns the murder of George Floyd that occurred in the United States of America at the hands of law enforcement officers and wishes to extend his deepest condolences to his family and loved ones\u201d.\n\nAt this pulpit, he also urged America to sort the discrimination based on race and ethnic origin. Truly a pan-African spirit, not so? Indeed, pan-Africanism was born out of concern over the predicament of black people in Africa and in the diaspora.\n\nThe word of the AU chairman was not enough, the deputy also went to his Facebook page and added his voice: \u201cThe African Union is distressed to witness yet another unwarranted execution of another African-American male, George Floyd, for no other reason than BEING BLACK. This is one too many\u201d. He also demanded for the case to be fully investigated. Wonderful! Extremely concerned about the well-being of black people.\n\nWe won\u2019t blame the AU. I am sure these loving officials never receive news of killings by African governments. But even if they do, their silence to killings by African security organs is in good faith. They care so much that such news sends them into speechlessness. What would they say? When it comes to brutality by African governments, the African Union opens its mouth, as if to say something, only to yawn and remain quiet.\n\nOh, but maybe we just fail to hear them. I was away during the Kasese massacre. I heard that almost 100 civilians were decimated. Those of you that heard, tell me. Did you hear any word from the AU, at least a Facebook post by a sweeper at the headquarters? Did they call for a speedy investigation?\n\nWhat a lousy question I am asking! How could they? That would be interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign member state. Wow! It is a smart club of team players, well equipped with selective speech.\n\nThey must be deeply pained by the death of George Floyd outside their area of mandate, but not equally moved to speak about the gospel artiste cum government critic that died in a Rwandan jail recently under mysterious circumstances. No, they didn\u2019t hear about that. Don\u2019t be too hard on them.\n\nThey do not hear about opposition politicians brutally pounced on by African governments. Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, etc are far away from them. They only follow news coming from places where black lives are supposed to matter. Yes, black lives matter abroad or where whites are involved.\n\nHere in Africa, as long as it is a black dictator hitting dissenting fellow black people, let them hit. That is a lesser evil than being hit by whites, if the latter is evil at all. If a police car drives over a young opposition activist to death in Uganda, that is lighter than a white police officer pressing his knee onto a blackman\u2019s neck in America.\n\nMaybe we shouldn\u2019t be too quick to judge the AU, let\u2019s wait until a white police officer puts his knee on the neck of an African. The knee of African governments can never be bad enough on black people\u2019s necks as to deserve the AU\u2019s voice.\n\nBut even the whiteman\u2019s knee may only be bad enough if it is outside Africa. As long as the whiteman is in bed with an African government, whatever they do to the damn Africans and their resources calls for no condemnation. Those are internal matters that need to be handled with diplomatic carefulness.\n\nWe love you AU; how else would we have taught our children about scarecrows! The good news is that many African dictators have been sorted without your help. If any help, yours was for the dictators. True solidarity, they always count on you \u2013 at least on your perpetual silence about their atrocities and feigned blindness about their acts.\n\nThey can rob their countries dry. It is okay for thousands to die in abandoned hospitals as public funds are siphoned away, as long as they don\u2019t die with a white knee on their neck. Don\u2019t call for action. Don\u2019t call for accountability.\n\nAt best, only pretend to care - as you wait for a news-making opportunity for condemning evil elsewhere. Seize the opportunity and pull out your robes of care to preach against black suffering and disregard. We will believe you. Trust me, we see no irony.\n\nWhat do you want to condemn next? I can make some good suggestions for you. I have seen protesters in America being sprayed with teargas, and some few beaten.\n\nKindly condemn this use of excessive force on protestors. Don\u2019t mind, it is abroad and, therefore, safe to call out. Condemn Trump\u2019s threat of sending in the military to handle the protests. Say something please for international news, or else we might forget that you exist and matter.\n\nWhy would America allow all those protestors on streets? Down here, dare announce a protest against government action. Your house will be cordoned off before you wake up. Protests are effectively (de facto) illegal. But, hey! That\u2019s none of your business. Call out those American security officers. Teach them about proper policing and that black lives matter. Africans will fight for themselves as you preach abroad.

As the theme of the WED stands \u2013 Time for Nature \u2013 biodiverse agroecological food systems have been central to life within the Buganda kingdom and most of Uganda.\n\nWorld Environment day comes on the heels of the Global Nutrition Report 2020 that was launched online mid-May by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN. The importance of having a balanced and nutritious diet emanates from good food sources that come from landscapes with healthy soils. Uganda as a country is blessed with agroclimatic conditions that make the landscape suitable for a wide range of vegetables to grow.\n\nMost of these vegetables are traditional, which grow mostly during the rainy season. Many communities have been dependent on them for hundreds of years. These traditional vegetables have been credited for high nutritional value providing people with the much-needed micronutrients, ascorbic acid and mostly vitamins A and C and dietary fiber. These traditional vegetables grow mostly around forests and wetland systems near cultivated areas.\n\nScientific findings have shown that Vitamin A, for example, is important for children\u2019s development and as such should be a part of their diet and that of lactating mothers. Examples of these traditional vegetables that have formed part of the Luganda culture include Ensugga (Solarium nigrum), Ejjobyo (Gynandropsisgynandra), Ttimpa (Colocasiaesculenta) to mention but a few. The traditional vegetables have not only been sources of food but also historically used to source products such as dyes, coffee substitutes, ornamentals and many others.\n\nThe Kingdom of Buganda and all of Uganda indeed relies heavily on agroecological and agriculture most of which is subsistence. Covid-19 has also demonstrated how a compromised immunity could prove deadly.\n\nWe strongly believe that biodiversity conservation is critical to maintaining ecosystem services that support agriculture. Practiced for hundreds of years, in Buganda, agroecological and traditional practices have left buffer zones or uncultivated sections that are adjacent to a forest or wetland ecosystem. With this, we have seen an increase in bees and other biodiversity necessary for pollination and other wildlife that support pest control.\n\nBuganda calls for recognition that our food systems are dependent mainly on family farms most of which are managed and tilled by women. As the UN Decade on Family Farming comes into effect, it coincides with the incoming UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030) that calls for the conservation of the agroecological systems that we have.\n\nUnfortunately, many ecosystems \u2013 forests, wetlands and agroecological zones - have been degraded and as such compromise the food systems we depend on. This is further compounded by climate change whose impacts affect the most vulnerable, particularly women.\n\nA loss of biodiversity, particularly the traditional vegetables, could not only result in the impairment of ecological but also cultural functions. Cultural uses of these vegetables are associated with traditional ceremonies and beliefs such as weddings, births and receiving of visitors.\n\nBuganda acknowledges the central and pivotal role women play in agroecological food systems. It also recognizes the challenges and burden that climate change places on women and children.\n\nEffects such as land conversion, droughts, floods and disease have resulted in the loss of some of these traditional vegetables. The recent flooding dynamic, for instance, around the Lake Victoria region demonstrates how the impact of climate change continues to affect vulnerable communities.\n\nAs the Sustainable Development Goals clearly stipulate \u2013 we should \u201cLeave No One Behind.\u201d There are research efforts to within Uganda to revive the conservation of traditional food systems particularly vegetables.\n\nCovid-19 clearly provided an opportunity of how we should treat nature differently.\n\nIndeed, Time for Nature \u2013 is NOW.\n\nThe author is the Nnabagekera of the Kingdom of Buganda.", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65213-let-s-protect-our-nature-with-everything", "published": "2020-06-10T01:51:42+03:00"}, {"title": "George Floyd is a message to be read", "author": ["Fr.

America is a country that has been generous to many individuals and countries, but hidden in the cockles of her heart is a dark secret that once in a while rears its ugly head.\n\nWe saw it through the egregious acts of murder of George Floyd, and we saw it in the weaponizing of whiteness by Amy Cooper against the African American Christian Cooper in New York\u2019s Central Park. Too many questions to ask about the true impulses that drive the country.\n\nWhen I arrived in the United States for graduate studies, I did not know I was black! I had never given much attention to the color of my skin. I had lived and worked in Uganda side by side with many white brothers and sisters.\n\nI had never been openly, or subtly been treated as less than; neither had I ever been made to feel I had anything wrong with me. Living in America, a country that has been so generous to me in many ways, has robbed me of part of my innocence.\n\nWhile the US Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, the US society still struggles with an insidious racial problem particularly against people of color.\n\nThe ghosts of the country\u2019s problematic racial history still haunt its economics, politics, religion, access to healthcare, employment, and its criminal justice system. With hindsight, I can look back and make some sense of why some commuters on a packed morning train preferred to stand, while next to me lay two empty seats.\n\nFor a year I volunteered at San Quentin prison in California and I witnessed a horrifyingly disproportionate number of black people in prison.\n\nMost were in prison due to drug-related violent crime. But then I came to learn through listening to their stories the kinds of backgrounds where they were born and raised. Many grew up in rat-infested, over-policed neighbourhoods with limited access to a good and strong education; and limited proper employment opportunities.\n\nThe only industry open and employing in some of the black neighbourhoods was the drug industry. As one of the wealthiest countries on earth, I found it appalling that some African Americans barely speak standard English, can\u2019t get employment, and some are homeless and live under highway bridges or in homeless camps.\n\nTo a country that has invested billions of dollars in space exploration programs to find life on other planets, it is confusing why it cannot take care of its citizens who are on the margins.\n\nAs we think about the death of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and the profiling of Christian Cooper, it is time for us Ugandans to reflect upon prejudices especially against people of other ethnic communities.\n\nNo one applied to God to be born the way they are, or in the places where they were born. We have to guard against any unfounded prejudices or stereotyping of other people, because we are witnesses to it ugly consequences to individuals, communities, and whole countries.\n\nThe writer is a Catholic priest and doctoral student at the University of Texas Austin.", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65211-george-floyd-is-a-message-to-be-read", "published": "2020-06-10T01:48:09+03:00"}, {"title": "Deepening social security is NSSF\u2019s dilemma during COVID-19", "author": ["Paul Mukiibi", "Wadada Rogers"], "text": "Social security is any contributory scheme such as employment providence funds, insurance, health programs, or any program that involves a payment usually compelled by law.\n\nSocial security refers to protective and preventive interventions to mitigate factors that lead to income shocks and affect consumption. It may be a formal system or arrangement concerned with protection against socially recognized conditions, including poverty, old age, disability, unemployment, sickness, and orphanage.\n\nArticle 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), states that every member of society has a right to social security. The critical concern here is whether the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) can enable its members to access their savings especially in situations like the ensuing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn so doing, it is important to examine its strategic intent, functions, and legal status on the one hand and the concerns of the savers on the other to chart a nexus if possible.\n\nThe Fund was established as a statutory body under the NSSF Act. It seeks as its philosophy to provide social security benefits as prescribed by law through the efficient and effective management of the Fund.\n\nThe major functions of the Fund are to collect members\u2019 contributions, maintain their accounts, enforce compliance, invest the collected funds, pay interest on accounts, and benefits to members.\n\nThe Fund operates a natural saving scheme mandatorily under its Act. The Fund operates a contributory scheme where employees and employers mandatorily contribute 5% (deducted directly from the monthly wage) and 10% respectively of the employees\u2019 gross monthly wage.\n\nThe scheme only covers employees of the private sector and parastatals but not employees of the civil service. Voluntary savers also participate in the scheme where they voluntarily contribute, however, they form a very small proportion of the membership.\n\nIn recent times, some proposals have been made to amend the NSSF Act while others have been passed into law. The legal scope of the national social security system is, therefore, worth consideration.\n\nThe NSSF Act provides for only five categories of benefits, namely: age, withdrawal, emigrant, invalidity, and survivor\u2019s benefits. None of the five benefits caters for a situation of natural calamities and other global pandemics unless it is defined within the five benefits.\n\nIncome inequality in Uganda remains a serious problem, the fact that employees contributing to the Fund have different salary scales explains why some are left with less to save and their only hope is in the mandatory saving with the Fund.\n\nIn situations of calamities, enormous pressure is exerted on the Fund to redeem their savings to meet their immediate needs. This however seems to be impossible given the current legal impediments.\n\nResponding to the enormous pressure from savers through a media statement (dated 24th March 2020), Richard Byarugaba, the Managing Director of NSSF contends that partial payments to savers would be discriminatory. He observed that the Fund had 1.5million members, and if they were given relief from the Fund, the vast majority of the 19 million working population would be left out.\n\nHe further observed that about 80% of the Fund\u2019s assets were tied up in government treasury bonds which would require government buying back its bonds to liquidate the Fund. This argument in terms of inadequate liquidity tends to hold water but perhaps not in terms of reform.\n\nDespite the assertions, the hard times caused by the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the lockdown of businesses has forced most of the savers have unsuccessfully petitioned the Fund to access (not very clear) their savings due to the ensuring legal impediments.\n\nThis calls for legal reform to introduce social safety opportunities that do not deny potential beneficiaries livelihood opportunities especially during hard times where their normal social networks and income sources have been severely interrupted.\n\nIn its present form, the Fund is a Provident Fund - it provides for the payment of a lump sum, at the end of a fixed period of membership. The core focus of a Provident Fund is, therefore, to maximize and pay a higher return on the lump sum.\n\nThe proposed mid-term access to members\u2019 savings is only in respect of a few members who have voluntarily contributed to the Fund to enjoy midterm access. The intention is to insert an amendment to Sec. 10 proposed to be Sec. 24A to the effect that; \u201cA member who has made voluntary contributions to the Fund shall be allowed mid-term access to his or her benefits on such terms and conditions and in a manner prescribed by the regulations.\u201d\n\nWhereas this is a good development, it only caters for a small proportion of the savers and does not address the current or future global pandemics or natural disasters.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) has defined Social Security as the protection that society provides to individuals to ensure access to health care and guarantee income security, particularly in cases of old age, unemployment, sickness, invalidity, work injury, maternity or loss of a breadwinner.\n\nCovid-19 has resulted in the loss of jobs to the majority of Ugandans especially those in the private sector, whose contracts are being terminated daily.\n\nThe pandemic occurred in a period when most employees were neither prepared nor anticipated. This is because many families have lost resilience and have become vulnerable even when they were hitherto not affecting their livelihood opportunities. Most employees have resorted to asking food from the government, a situation that confirms a serious economic challenge.\n\nAmidst Covid-19, some employees in Kasese have been seriously hit by floods, left homeless without any food to survive. What better timing can a saver benefit from the Fund?\n\nThere is, therefore, a need to broaden the amendments to the Act to cover situations of this kind. World over, the Covid-19 pandemic has challenged several countries and they are seriously planning ahead of time.\n\nWith the NSSF Act before Parliament for amendment to allow voluntary contributors mid-term access of 20% of savings, this opportunity should also be seized to ensure a comprehensive reform to protect even mandatory savers beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSuch reform should address the core underpinnings of social security encompassed in the ILO definition of particularly \u2013 income security and unemployment. Why would a saver, for example, starve and die of hunger and only have beneficiaries redeem savings on account of the orphanage?\n\nAcademics, policymakers, civil society groups, and other key stakeholders should interest themselves in this area to reform the way social security is understood including dismantling how it is narrowly defined by Uganda\u2019s existing legislations.\n\npmpaulmukiibi@gmail.com\n\nThe author is a senior partner at Mukiibi and Kyeyune Advocates and a Lecturer at Law Development Centre.", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65212-deepening-social-security-in-uganda-is-nssf-s-dilemma-during-covid-19", "published": "2020-06-10T01:06:22+03:00"}, {"title": "Public service pension: old wine in new bottles!", "author": [], "text": "For a long time, the public service pension scheme has been fraught with confusion and corruption.\n\nIf the fictitious pensioners are not created by corrupt officials in the Public Service ministry, majority of genuine pensioners are never paid on time. Some even die before they are paid their full benefits.\n\nIt is even harder for the dependents to claim benefits owed to their deceased relatives. Right now the ministry of Public Service has forwarded at least 7,874 pensioners to the Inspector General of Government for investigation after they did not turn up for the validation exercise between June and July last year.\n\nThose suspicious cases of 7,874 pensioners worth Shs 2.65b per month were deleted from the payroll in 2019 because they were doubtable cases. Question is, who has been collecting their pension before the verification exercise was conducted. This case alone, illustrates the inherent vices that have plagued the pension structure over the years.\n\nIt is estimated that the government wage bill has over the years increased from Shs 4.2 trillion to Shs 5 trillion.

Now the ministry of public service wants to reform this scheme.\n\nThe minister of Public Service Wilson Mururi Mukasa announced recently that government was to introduce a contributory public service pension scheme.\n\nThe minister explained that the new scheme was intended to address governance, accountability and equity problems associated with the current unfunded scheme. The idea of a contributory pension scheme is a fully funded pension scheme that generates adequate funds through certain percentage contributions from monthly earnings by both employee and employer.\n\nAnd this would apply to all pensionable employees in the public service of the central government, local governments, and tertiary institutions.\n\nHowever, the minister did not clarify whether the pensionable persons would be entitled to lumpsum payment upon discharge from active service. In the current arrangement, the payment is usually in monthly installments and they are fixed.\n\nWhereas the reforms in the pension sector are needed, they must come with guarantees that this time round pensioners will not be shortchanged.\n\nThe reforms need to create pathways that give pensioners relevant tools to engage and participate in the governance and regulation of their pension.\n\nAnd improvement in how a government delivers pension benefits is only possible if the bureaucrats in this ministry endorse sensible rules and practices that allow for change while making the best use of tested practices.

Although the government spends less on the sector, it needs to properly account for every penny. Serious mismanagement and corruption in the system, however, threatens any advances on health of all Ugandans.\n\nThe government has to pool resources to fund health research in universities, pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies with an aim of improving the health among citizens. Currently, there are six public and six private medical schools in the country.\n\nGovernment must have a comprehensive plan when it comes to health care system. This ranges from setting up a national health insurance for all citizens to setting up modern hospitals with facilities and necessary human capital needed to run them.\n\nLastly, the government must learn to keep the health care staff motivated.

In recognition of this, courts have stressed the need for governments to exercise restraint in applying criminal remedies when restricting fundamental rights.\n\nOf recent, Uganda has become burdened with people bewilderedly insulting the honour and dignity of leaders, expressed in obscene form.\n\nThis brings me to controversial self-claimed social activist Frank Malingumu Gashumba and his recent insults against Charles Peter Mayiga, the Katikkiro (Prime Minister) of Buganda Kingdom.\n\nGashumba is fond of wanting to bring down people with a proven track record in leadership and business.

However, America has been here before: after the Civil War which ended in 1865, and again in the 1960s during the Civil Rights era, where legislation was not entirely translated into equitable change throughout the country.\n\nWill the recent and tragic deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and countless others force real and substantive reform throughout all facets of American society?

Even leaders at lower authorities can be dictators and their dictatorship is always ugly.\n\nLast week, I watched with dismay how the deputy speaker of Uganda's parliament Rt Hon Jacob Oulanyah was embarrassed in parliament and in front of cameras. Oulanyah sought permission from Kadaga almost three or four times to speak, but Kadaga turned down all his requests.\n\nAt first, she adjourned the house and beckoned her deputy to follow her to her chambers so they can talk one-on-one. Later when the house resumed, Oulanya sought permission again to speak, but again, he was not allowed and that's how he left the house.\n\nA few weeks ago, Kadaga started a battle against the judiciary and executive. She accused the two arms of government of interfering with the business of parliament, which she vowed to protect. She actually held a press briefing and expressed her anger before the public. She did the unusual and the unthinkable when she addressed the nation in her native Lusoga language.\n\nThat move means that the speaker intended to provoke and incite anger from the people of her region. A few days later, we read a story of how the speaker had secretly handed over the Shs 20m to the district COVID-19 task force. By action, she had conceded to the executive and judiciary. Remember, court directed MPs to return the Covid-19 money they allocated themselves to parliament or send it their respective district task forces.\n\nOulanyah did the good thing and was among the first MPs who returned the money. However, it seems some people felt betrayed and later an MP on the floor, rose to move a motion of displeasure against the deputy speaker for defying parliament.\n\nKadaga strangely did not stop that debate implying that she was very okay with it. Because it was done outside the law and the parliamentary order of procedure, Oualanyah wanted that motion off the Hansard. Why didn't the MPs also move a motion of displeasure against Kadaga when she also returned the money.\n\nKadaga is always seething for a fight and embarrass people in public. That is how she fought and forced former parliament's public relations officer Chris Obore to resign. Up to now, nobody knows how why it was done. Obore decided to keep mum, but I think if he chose to let the people know, Ugandans would be shocked.\n\nOf late, Kadaga has turned parliament into a one woman's show, where Oulanya hasn't been allowed to chair any session in the past 3-4 months. This is not happening by mistake. I don't know if parliament has any law to guide on how many sessions should be chaired by the speaker and how many should be chaired by the deputy.\n\nThis is something that should be looked into in future because we can't tell how the speaker will behave against his or her deputy as parliament does its business. Kadaga served under Edward Ssekandi for many years and there's no single day when she was embarrassed by her boss like she did to Oulanyah.\n\nThe writer is an aspiring western youth member of parliament.", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65176-it-was-wrong-for-kadaga-to-embarrass-oulanyah", "published": "2020-06-08T23:06:44+03:00"}, {"title": "Kobusingye\u2019s book, The Patient reminds Ugandans \u2018You Are on Your Own\u2019", "author": ["Yusuf Serunkuma", "Charles Dicken Oruk"], "text": "The publication of Dr Olive Kobusingye\u2019s book, The Patient: Sacrifice, Genius, Greed in Uganda\u2019s Healthcare System, coincided with the arrival of Covid-19, making the book exceedingly timely.\n\nNarrated from the vantage point of health workers, Kobusingye\u2019s contention is that Uganda\u2019s healthcare has been in a perpetual condition of ailment \u2013 causing many medics to flee either the profession or the country.\n\nBut while the period 1960-1980s saw medics especially at Mulago suffer political challenges, emanating from direct conflicts with political leaders, the 1980s-onwards saw \u201cinternal work\u201d challenges as the major afflictions facing health workers.\n\nAnd this is not due to lack of resources but, rather, misguided political priorities. While the 1960-80s challenges including mostly direct threats to life of health workers, involving assassinations and imprisonment, the \u201cinternal work\u201d challenges of the 1980s include shortage of equipment, shortage of drugs, salary issues, poor working conditions, etcetera.\n\nBoth of them dangerous to the industry. But this switch in the causes of pain to doctors speaks to a theoretical-historical shift in the logic of social policy in Uganda, and needs to be emphasised.\n\nConsider the painful stories of Dr Kibukamusoke and Dr Obache who were murdered by State Research, or Dr D\u2019Arbela, and Dr Kanyerezi who had to flee for their lives.\n\nThese stories are as painful as the stories of a young man selling curtains in downtown Kampala, who had abandoned the medical profession as an intern student.\n\nThe young doctor \u201chad lost three babies in one night because the Intensive Care Unit had no oxygen. After running around Mulago to find oxygen, the young doctor narrates that he \u201cwent back to the ward to find the third baby gasping. The mother was wailing.\n\n\u201cI left the ward and did not come back the following day. But by the time I had made up my mind to either leave the country or the profession.\u201d\n\nAlso painful is the story of Dr KK, who also recalls \u201cmany distressing nights during which she swore to leave medicine altogether.\u201d\n\nIn both periods, doctors are fleeing the profession, fleeing service to their country. But the reasons for fleeing are a product of different regimes of power. From reading Kobusingye\u2019s new book, you quickly realise that despite the political challenges of the time, the 1960 -1980s public service/social policy was rooted in an anti-colonial longing for national cohesion; there was a competitive developmentalist incentive.\n\nThe anti-colonial intelligentsia who dominated this period wanted to make sure things worked. Slogans of pan- Africanism, African renaissance, Marxist chants against exploitation animated this period. Even the much-maligned President Amin made sure things worked.\n\nKobusingye narrates that, \u201cAmin singled out the doctors and judges for unexpected favours. He gave senior consultants Mercedes Benzes, and other doctors got cars as well. As the self-declared economic war was intensified and commodities disappeared from the market, Amin created a special outlet for doctors in Industrial Area. From here, doctors would be allocated sugar, beer, salt and rice at very low prices...Likewise, Amin had a fuel pump installed at Old Mulago close to the Polio Hostel for the exclusive use of doctors.\u201d\n\nThe 1980s onwards then saw the arrival of Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs), which actually not only obliterated African economies, but also ushered in a new consciousness. Citizens became private individuals, which then privatised livelihoods.\n\nI argued in The Observer column (May 27), the pain of structural adjustment is not simply the corrupt-ridden dismantling of cooperatives and parastatals, which actually ruined many economies \u2013 as had been predicted.\n\nIt is neither the absurdity of governments abandoning key public goods and services, leaving them in the hands of ordinary folks. It is the culture it created: \u201cYou Are On Your Own.\u201d\n\nBeing on one\u2019s own even in things clearly so big for a private person became the normal consciousness. This is why we hire private security guards for our homes (even when we proudly hail Museveni for \u201cgiving us\u201d sleep). This is why private health clinics are in big business, even when Mulago now has four branches.\n\nPrivate schools are flourishing despite the rolling out of Universal Primary Education (UPE) and Universal Secondary Education (USE). Quality or true social welfare is found in the private, the personal. The logic that drives public service/social policy presently could be summarised in the phrase, \u201cyou are on your own.\u201d\n\nCovid-19 found us in this blighted state. It is not surprising that government relief supplies come as a favour, and not an obligation. But there is more: SAPs in Uganda found a leadership of former rebels who simply saw an opportunity to enrich themselves.\n\nLike hungry hyenas, they devoured all assets that had hitherto supported the public good: plots of lands and houses in Kololo and Nakasero, Uganda Transport Company (UTC), Uganda Railways, Uganda Electricity Board (UEB), Uganda Coffee Marketing, were all eaten in a terrible pursuit of primitive accumulation.\n\nPresently, this has reached vampirish levels of stealing cash in shady officially sanctioned deals: Kobusingye reminds her readers of the $12 million that was stolen in Global Fund money meant for the treatment of HIV, malaria and tuberculosis; millions meant for immunisation stolen in the ministry of Health (GAVI scandal).\n\nRecently, Lubowa Specialised hospital had $379.17 million misappropriated. But the annexation of Entebbe Grade A hospital in 2011 by State House, which meant closing the hospital\u2019s doors to over 100,000 patients, captures agency of individuals even more sharply: inspired by the capitalist logic of leaving individuals to themselves \u2013 with many indirect taxes \u2013 accumulation by dispossession has become more the norm.\n\nAnd you can say pretty much the same things about other aspects of social welfare.\n\nyusufkajura@gmail.com\n\nThe author is a PhD fellow at Makerere Institute of Social Research.", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65121-kobusingye-s-book-the-patient-reminds-ugandans-you-are-on-your-own", "published": "2020-06-03T17:34:57+03:00"}, {"title": "Bank of Uganda revises growth forecast downwards to 2%", "author": ["Alon Mwesigwa", "Wadada Rogers", "P. Goldberg"], "text": "Bank of Uganda has further cut growth forecasts to just over 2 per cent, an indicator that the impact of coronavirus disease on the economy is deeper than earlier thought.\n\nIn the June monetary policy statement issued today Monday, the central bank said that the economy will expand by between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent during the financial year 2019/2020, a drop from an earlier projection of 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent growth.\n\nBank of Uganda (BOU) governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile said even this growth will depend on how the economy is opened up from the lockdown imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus disease. It would also depend on how the public will comply with the social distancing rules to ensure cases don\u2019t surge again calling for more lockdown, Mutebile said.\n\nAlready cases are surging, an indicator of more hard times ahead. Mutebile says the economy will get back to 4 per cent growth in 2021 and go to 6 per cent in 2022.\n\nFor the ordinary Ugandan, the low growth forecast has implications on their employment, their dependents\u2019 ability to keep helping them or receive money from their children abroad. Most businesses have been shut for close to 80 days of the lockdown. A lot of them have either laid off staff or cut their pay so that they can survive the crisis.\n\nMore than 100, 000 people formally employed have lost their jobs while 4.4 million people from the informal sector will either see their earnings fall below the poverty line or dry up completely, according to the UN Capital Development Fund.\n\nThe Bank of Uganda statement today is an indicator that things are grimmer than earlier thought despite President Yoweri Museveni optimism that things are not as bad as being predicted.\n\nMuseveni said last week that at least 107 factories had come up to make sanitizers while at least 61 companies have applied to make masks. This is no comparison to the collapsing businesses in tourism, diaspora remittances and postponements of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by investors.\n\nTo boost business activity, Mutebile further cut the central bank rate (CBR) to 7 per cent from 8 per cent in April. The lower the CBR, the more the banks access cheap money and therefore are expected to lend to businesses cheaply. If businesses can borrow, it means they can invest and hire more people.\n\nBOU says that average interest rates are at 17 per cent but this is far expensive than most businesses can afford during this crisis.\n\nHowever, Muhammad Ssempijja, a partner at audit firm Ernst and Young, said even with reduced CBR, demand for loans will not be high because lockdown is still on and businesses are not working at full capacity. He said that companies to ask for loans will \u201cdepend on how COVID-19 infections turn out.\u201d\n\nThe impact of BoU decision, Ssempijja said, will be much lower than the central bank would have wanted.

The author believes the same should be applied to all SMEs\n\nOver the weekend, several senior managers at the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) tendered in their resignations ostensibly to pursue other careers.\n\nSocial media, as is usually the case, went overboard with some people claiming it was a purge and that the officers did not choose to resign, but rather forced to do so.\n\nURA issued a statement saying the board made recommendations concerning the \u201creorganization and management\u201d but \u201csome senior officials chose to resign, and the board accepted their resignation.\u201d There is nothing new in mass resignations in organisations following an appointment of a new boss.\n\nHowever, what concerned me was the statement, which talked about \u201creorganization and management of URA\u201d though my concern is not merely in the personnel, those can always be replaced. The way URA works is what needs to change, and I hope the \u201creorganization and management\u201d will consider small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThere is a need to change or push to change the many taxes that end up strangling small businesses. The income tax rate is at 30%, excise duty at 15%, withholding tax at 6% and VAT at 18%. All these taxes may be fine for large organizations, but for small companies, they are a death sentence.\n\nSo, imagine a company that gets a Shs 100m contract, runs to the bank to get a loan to execute the assignment and the loan is granted at 24%. If they pay all those taxes and the interest fee, what do they remain with?\n\nBut before the company even gets a contract, it must submit a tax clearance certificate (TCC). Some years ago, URA people sat in a boardroom and came up with an ingenious idea \u2014TCC must be issued per bid.\n\nSo, if you are bidding for work in company A today, you apply for a TCC that goes to company A and if tomorrow you need to make another bid to company B, you apply for another TCC. Never mind that you just got a TCC a day before. The funny thing is that today URA can issue you a TCC and tomorrow they can reject to give you one.\n\nThis process of applying a TCC per bid is another cost for SMEs because many rely on external consultants to process these certificates for them. Why doesn\u2019t URA issue a TCC for say six months or one year? If they fear that SMEs will forge them, they can a create verification system. If people can quickly verify vehicle registration at URA, why can\u2019t they verify whether a TCC is genuine or not?\n\nTaxes like VAT should also be reformed where SMEs do not have to pay URA once an invoice is issued rather when they have been paid. I know there is an option for this but its administration is even more complicated than paying URA before a company is paid because you must have paid all your VAT before you allowed this option. Where does an SME get the money to pay taxes for money it is not sure will be paid on top of servicing loans at crazy rates?\n\nURA sometime back introduced a very good system where some types of businesses are charged a set rate as income tax. They call it a presumptive tax.\n\nBusinesses like salons pay this rate instead of self-assessments. The figure payable is set regardless of the profit made. I think this is a very good way of taxing SMEs. However, they left out many businesses that could pay more taxes if they were asked to pay a fixed rate. Self-assessments are cumbersome to both the small taxpayers and URA.\n\nThe URA needs many staff to look at documents before they accept that the self-assessment is correct. Many times, URA refuses self-assessments and institutes charges that are way above what an SME made in a year. That involves a lot of back and forth before the tax is paid if ever paid. There is a need to widen businesses that pay a presumptive tax rate but also consider the size of business.\n\nThe other alternative is to have an income limit where, for example, if the business earns less than a certain amount a year, it is allowed to pay a presumptive tax than going through the cumbersome processes of self-assessment. This will reduce the number of companies filing zero profits and, therefore, paying nothing in income tax.\n\nAlso, URA needs to handle SMEs differently. For example, the assessment forms for withholding tax exemptions should not be the same for all taxpayers. A simple form for a small business is sufficient whereas, for the largest taxpayers, they can have a form that fits their size.\n\nAs URA was issuing statements about its staff resignations, MTN was issuing another regarding a tax case involving Shs 326 billion which the telecom giant questioned in court. The assessment came to Shs 24 billion but MTN further appealed to the Tax Appeals Tribunal. To cut the long story short, MTN got an interim order against the enforcement of URA notices.\n\nMTN, as a large company, can afford silver-tongued lawyers and appeal even for 20 years but SMEs cannot. A mere lack of a TCC is a disqualification from a potential contract.\n\nExcessive assessments from URA simply lead to heart attacks for the owners and closure of the businesses. URA enforcement officers also love small companies \u2014 they quickly attach bank accounts, put padlocks on the premises and such other things. For the big boys, they simply sit on the table or go to court.\n\nChanges at URA, therefore, should not stop at just personnel. Customer care is critical if URA is to achieve its tax targets and SMEs can play a critical role if URA invested time and resources to understand them and address their challenges.\n\ndjjuuko@gmail.com\n\nThe writer is a communication and visibility consultant.", "link": "https://observer.ug/businessnews/65077-ura-changes-should-address-sme-challenges", "published": "2020-06-05T01:49:03+03:00"}, {"title": "UDB\u2019s Shs 1 trillion package to bail out agrobusinesses", "author": ["Alon Mwesigwa"], "text": "The ministry of Finance has approved the injection of Shs one trillion in Uganda Development Bank (UDB) for the next financial year as part of government\u2019s Covid-19 stimulus package to make capital available in investment in areas where Ugandans have comparative advantage, writes ALON MWESIGWA.\n\nLast Thursday, UDB presented its 2019/2020 financial year results that saw the bank\u2019s profit after tax improve by seven per cent from Shs 9.4bn in 2018 to Shs 10.4bn in 2019.\n\nWhile presenting the package, Evelyn Anite, the state minister of Finance for Investment and Privatization, assured UDB of government\u2019s commitment to see the bank\u2019s success, especially to build the capacity of Ugandan businesses.\n\nFelix Okoboi, the UDB board chairman, noted that most of the funding for the Shs one trillion will go to agriculture, agroindustry, and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to government because it has come at a time when the year 2020 has become challenging because of Covid-19 pandemic. Most importantly, Ugandan businesses are going to benefit, and people are going to see this money firsthand in the sectors that are key for the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoboi also said UDB has amended its strategic plan for the 2019/2020 financial year to ensure compliance with the national development plan cycle. This means the bank will encourage more direct lending even when UDB continues to collaborate with government-owned financial institutions such as Post bank, Housing Finance bank, and Pride Microfinance, among others.\n\n\u201cThere have been several questions asked of recent: Is UDB a wholesale bank? Is it going to stop direct lending? There are many benefits of direct lending, some of which are not even financial,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWith direct lending, you get in touch with the end beneficiary and that learning falls through with UDB\u2019s other role of thought leadership, knowledge dissemination and you cannot do that if you one level is removed from the lending process. We feel we need to be in touch with the end beneficiary to be able to add value in policy debates about where the money is needed.\u201d\n\nPatrick Ocailap, the deputy secretary to the Treasury, said the Shs one trillion is part of government\u2019s ongoing strategic direction to make capital available in investment in areas where we have comparative advantage.\n\n\u201cIn order to do that, the ministry has come up with four key strategies. We aim to increase household incomes and improve upon the welfare of households engaged in agricultural production. We also aim to engage in value addition for these commodities in a consistent manner through creation of employment in the value chain,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLastly, we shall be able to attain a sustainable level of economic growth by investing in these areas. What has been missing is affordable capital and this [Shs one trillion] is a stitch in time.\u201d\n\nOcailap also emphasized that food security, industrialization and import substitution will be top priority for UDB while disbursing the money.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure we do most of the manufacturing in the country and generally to lift the people\u2019s wellbeing through such interventions. This will greatly reduce the import bill on products that we will produce here,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor example, we still import agricultural products like cooking oil, beef and meat products, fish products, coffee, tea and many more. These are things we can produce domestically and be able to offset that import bill while the excess can be available for export.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that UDB is working towards an interest rate of 10 per cent.\n\nSOLID GROWTH\n\nAccording to the figures presented by Patricia Ojangole, the UDB managing director, the bank\u2019s profit after tax improved by seven per cent from Shs 9.4bn in 2018 to Shs 10.4bn in 2019.\n\n\u201cSo, amidst the challenging environment, UDB has performed well and we are happy for the government support throughout the year,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Ojangole, this was in part a result of the growth in the loan book and increase in capital by the shareholders. The bank\u2019s balance sheet increased by 31 per cent to Shs 486bn in 2019 from Shs 370bn in 2018. This growth is a result of the increase in funding from the shareholders and the drawdown of lines of credit that had been approved earlier.\n\n\u201cIn terms of development outcome, the bank continues to make a significant contribution in terms of jobs. Those created and maintained in 2019 were 28,313.

He brings to board more than 21 years of telecom experience having worked at in at least five countries in various capacities - holding executive and senior management roles in finance departments, including holding the CFO position at MTN Liberia and MTN Congo Brazzaville.\n\nSome of the key highlights of his career at MTN include concluding a $300m syndicated medium-term facility, in a project finance deal that won an award for the best telecoms deal in Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in 2012.\n\nAlthough Bugembe is taking over office at a difficult time when many company revenues are getting slashed by the global Covid-19 pandemic, the seasoned accountant is no stranger to operating amidst disasters like this one.\n\nHe spent a lot of time resizing the cost structures for a couple of MTN operating companies (OPCOs) to align with changing macro-economic trends especially during the Ebola crisis in West Africa and the drop in oil prices while in Central Africa.\n\nAs CFO of the country\u2019s highest taxpayer, Bugembe\u2019s key roles will be to drive the company profitability mandate, to ensure effective and efficient capital allocation, and to support service revenue growth through data analytics with focus on non-voice revenues.\n\nHe will also support key transformation initiatives, build internal capacity, support digitization with focus on fintech in addition to continuous cost optimization and improving working capital management among others.\n\nAccording to Bugembe, there are still growth opportunities for telecoms in Uganda, given that mobile penetration is barely over 51 per cent. The data penetration is still low driven mainly due to lower smartphone penetration, customer education and relevant digital content.\n\nThis, he says will be key for the future growth of telecoms in Uganda. He also notes that Uganda\u2019s youthful market coupled with the many SMEs, steady GDP growth and low inflation is a great opportunity for any business.\n\nWith the telecom trends indicating the customers\u2019 needs are changing towards data, fintech (mobile money) and digital, Bugembe believes these will drive the future of telecoms, especially in Uganda with emphasis on financial inclusion as the country moves towards a cashless economy.\n\nIn addition to the 21 years of telecom experience, Bugembe is a chartered accountant (FCCA-UK) with a Masters degree from the University of Wollongong in Australia and he holds a Bachelors of Commerce degree from India.\n\nBugembe describes himself as a passionate, curious and adaptive person, having lived, studied and worked in seven countries.

Magogo instead preferred to assemble a team of people who have never sacrificed anything tangible in Ugandan football.\n\nThat was the start of the end of Kirunda, who had to endure the last days of his life physically, mentally, and financially handicapped.\n\nHis death was greeted by an outpouring of eulogies from friends and former contemporaries. Fufa unashamedly pledged to take over the burial expenses of the man they ordered not to step a foot at the Fufa house.\n\nFufa then got their usual praise singers to spin the narrative of Kirunda\u2019s demise on his \u2018lack of planning after football.\u2019 This was despicable. Reading James Bakama\u2019s story that Fufa flatly and deliberately refused to contribute to Kirunda\u2019s Shs 1.7m medical bill got me very angry.\n\nWhy take food to Kirunda\u2019s burial when you would have given him that food to help him survive and live a dignified life?\n\nIt was wrong for Fufa to show concern after Kirunda\u2019s death, especially when they knew his poor health situation beforehand. Dr Lawrence Mulindwa had brought Kirunda on board to offer that much-needed technical support at Mengo but Magogo summarily fired him within a few days of taking office by throwing away Kirunda\u2019s files outside his office.\n\nI highly doubt Kirunda was getting more than Shs 1.5m per month but this was enough to sustain him for the time. That is why even President Museveni does not entirely get rid of his people who have served him; he retains them as presidential advisors.\n\nThe firing of Kirunda was just the start of Magogo\u2019s purge of ex-internationals and within a year, they had been scrapped as members of the Fufa assembly. Fufa is competing with the game they are purportedly supervising.\n\nThe hunger for amplifying egos and self-aggrandisement by Fufa officials \u2013 most of whom never played football \u2013 is a big motivation for them to diffuse emergence and contribution to football development by an organised group of former players. Instead they have opted to mobilise a few former football journeymen whom they pay and parade at Fufa assemblies to hoodwink the unsuspecting media and the public. It was a deliberate ploy to get rid of people with respectable profiles.\n\nA few years ago, I found Polly Ouma in dire straits and brought him at Villa as technical adviser. It had a lot to do with my desire to rehabilitate him after Fufa discarded him. But Fufa officials often pleaded with me to get rid of Ouma and mobilized some fans to fight him.\n\nI know the Fufa executive feels more secure by keeping the ex-internationals at arm\u2019s length but this is counterproductive because when the current generation of players see their heroes struggling, they become mercenaries, eager to get rich quick so that they can run away from the game with little focus on developing their careers\n\nThe deliberate act of dismembering footballing bodies like Ex-internationals is a clear testament that\n\nFor instance, I was shocked in 2017 when midfielder Nicholas Kasozi demanded I pay him $40,000 to return to Villa. His reasoning is that he has a few years in the sport and he has to milk every opportunity as possible.\n\nNow that Kirunda is gone, it is time for the current players and ex-internationals to know a player\u2019s value in the football chain. So long as Magogo and cohorts are still in charge, know that your importance starts and stops on the pitch and may be also to be paraded at State House while arm-twisting government for presidential envelopes.\n\nFufa can start atoning for Kirunda by apportioning part of the $500,000 to save ex-internationals or include their plight in the annual budget.\n\nThe least Fufa can do for Kirunda is to erect a monument in his honour.\n\njosephmbazzi@gmail.com\n\nThe author is Nyamityobora FC president.", "link": "https://observer.ug/sports/65074-demise-of-kirunda-reveals-fufa-s-purge-on-ex-internationals", "published": "2020-06-05T00:50:34+03:00"}, {"title": "Live Sport is back on DStv and GOtv", "author": ["Mark Namanya"], "text": "MultiChoice Uganda, the home of great pay TV entertainment in Uganda, has confirmed the resumption of live coverage of the world\u2019s top football leagues this month.\n\nThis is great news for DStv and GOtv customers, who are sport enthusiasts.

The Venoms, who were declared league champions recently, are part of the topflight clubs that want government support\n\nTen Uganda Premier League (UPL) clubs are pressing that a slice of the national cake goes to them when the 2020/2021 budget is read out.\n\nThrough a petition to the minister of Education and Sports, Janet Museveni, they are confident their lobby can be successful for long-term posterity. Diana Nyago (Busoga United), Benard Atiku (Ayivu County MP and Onduparaka) and Mwine Mpaka (Western Region Youth MP and Mbarara City FC) are some of the club chairpersons at the forefront of this petition that is backed by 10 UPL clubs.\n\nNyago told The Observer that they are engaging government for funding that can go into infrastructural development and recurrent expenditure.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are private entities, we contribute a lot by providing youth employment.\n\n\u201cBut you must also remember that we also engage in human development from the grassroots level since the clubs we run spot and nurture talent,\u201d Nyago explained.\n\nHowever, critics of the move feel that the UPL clubs want to take a share of the national budget that the Fufa receives from government. Fufa last year received at Shs 10 billion from government.\n\nHaving some of that money re-directed to the UPL is unlikely to please Fufa. In fact, it is likely to put Fufa and the clubs on a collision course. In addition, government has not been known to fund private entities like the UPL in the past.\n\nBut Nyago and her colleagues do not see it that way. She wondered what was private about footballers whose talent they help promote every year.\n\nNyago said: \u201cThese footballers we nurture are the ones that play for The Cranes. Yet, a lot goes into grooming and training them to become national team players.\n\n\u201cThat needs support if we are to sustain it.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Nyago\u2019s player Joel Madondo was part of the Cranes side that won the 2019 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup last December.\n\nSoon after, Madondo was signed by Wydad Casablanca football club in Morocco. In addition, Onduparaka produced Muhammad Shaban who has played for the country from youth level as has Mbarara City FC whose striker Brian Ahebwa was part of Cranes team preparing for the Chan tournament, that was called off in April due to the coronavirus.\n\nBesides that, Nyago argued that it was unreasonable for sports funding to stop at just the national team. She noted that for the football industry to grow, funding should be extensive and sustained right from the bottom rank. UPL clubs also take part in the Fufa Juniors League for under-17s, which is another set of 25 players they must facilitate.\n\nThis literally means the clubs run two teams including the senior one. Such are the enormous costs Nyago feels strain club bosses.\n\nIn May, UPL clubs asked Fufa to give them a share of the $1 million grant from Fifa. But Fufa declined, saying that the money had activities it was already budgeted to cover.\n\nNotably, the timing of all this is said to have been induced by the lockdown on sports that was triggered by Covid-19 pandemic. A number of clubs have been stretched financially, leaving their players unpaid. Apparently, even the league sponsors are unlikely to remit the last quarter payment to the clubs of Shs 19m for every team.\n\nFUFA REACTION\n\nNonetheless, for some clubs, the lack of salaries to their players dates back many months, long before even the lockdown. One club official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was left wondering whether there was a long-term strategic plan to this move to ensure that if government gives them a slice of the budget, it can propel them sustainably.\n\nIn Kenya, the government pledged to pay the players in the top flight football division $150 (Shs 555,000) each for the next three months, as support to the clubs.\n\nThe UPL clubs do not see why government cannot relieve them the same way it has been done in Kenya, at least for the start.\n\nIn Uganda\u2019s case, Fufa has opted for a different approach. In his weekly column, Fufa spokesman Ahmed Hussein said the federation will meet all clubs in the top tier and Fufa Big League today and on June 12.\n\nHe stated: \u2018The agenda for the meetings is about club licensing and sharing ideas on the proposed Fufa competitions reforms.

They are purely consultative meetings between Fufa and the clubs for the 2020/2021 season.

It is an area that Fufa needs to see clubs comply with certain criteria to participate in the Fufa/Caf/Fifa competitions. When such meetings are held, clubs are briefed on how the exercise leads to the issuance of licenses at the start of every season.\n\nThere are also advantages of early planning by clubs. For example, it can help in developing strong governance and organization structures, implementing stable financial management and reporting. It can also improve technical standards of coaches, increase reliability, credibility and integrity of the clubs and league, among others.\n\nNothing will be achieved if a lot of energies are put into running battles by the clubs against Fufa as already evidenced in the last two months.\n\nFootball needs to see the chief executive officers deliver on all fronts in regard to the clubs\u2019 administrative assignments like handling players and technical staff contract renewals, budgets for next season, incoming and outgoing players. All this can be achieved with the full support of the club owners and chairmen during this period.\n\nThe moment planning is missed by some clubs at this stage, the chances are high that these clubs will turn out to be culprits on failing to fullfill many items during the club licensing exercise.\n\nThere are clubs that need to improve from what they achieved in the just-concluded season when the 2020/2021 season kicks off. It is concerted efforts right from the lowest-ranked officer at the club to the top person who injects money in the team. Experience has it that many clubs which struggle during the off season face rough times when the action on the pitch gets underway.\n\nThe disorganization stems from the players failing to submit proper documents to their club leaders in time so that they can be able to verify with Fufa on the kind of information in the data system.\n\nWith the current wave of discontent by club leaders against Fufa, I pray that they don\u2019t take their eyes off the ball as the new season is just a few weeks away.\n\nEach club will set targets for the new season but all depends on how much they would have spared in terms of preparations during the off season and thereafter hit the ground running for the new campaign.\n\nahmeddh00@gmail.com\n\nThe author is Fufa communications director.", "link": "https://observer.ug/sports/65184-fufa-in-early-preps-for-new-season", "published": "2020-06-10T00:38:33+03:00"}, {"title": "Students embrace e-learning with MTN Zero", "author": ["Prisca Baike", "Grace"], "text": "By zero-rating e-learning websites, telecom giant MTN Uganda has enabled university students in the country to continue with their studies without worrying about data costs.\n\nStudents from universities including Makerere University, Uganda Christian University, Uganda Martyrs, Kyambogo, International University of East Africa, Mbarara and Gulu are the beneficiaries of the offer that also extends to primary and secondary students.\n\nIn phone interviews, university students said the high cost of accessing learning material online was limiting learning during the lockdown following the closure of schools in March. More than 15 million students at primary, secondary and higher institutions of learning levels were sent home as one of the measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n\n\u201cWhen universities closed in March, I thought it would be for a short time so I decided to take a break from studies and relax a bit,\u201d says Doreen Namuli, a second-year student of Economics at Makerere University.\n\n\u201cBut when the first three weeks ended, I started feeling rusty and I knew I had to read in order not to lose grips on what I had learnt and hopefully, use this time to read ahead.\u201d\n\nIt goes without saying that most university courses are research-based and average students typically spend more time in the library than in the lecture rooms. Therefore, reading notes and handouts alone did not make much sense to Namuli as she needed to refer to the referenced material which she did not have.\n\n\u201cBack at campus, I would easily download this material from the library or anywhere around the university with Wi-Fi,\u201d says Namuli \u201cSo I asked my parents to buy me data bundles.\u201d\n\nAlthough the bundles were availed, Namuli knows that they were costly especially at such a time when her mother\u2019s business remains closed due to the Covi19 prevention guidelines.\n\nLike Namuli, Lynn Kwikiriza, a third-year Law student at UCU admitted to the biting cost of data while studying at home; \u201cI was used to opting for the library Wi-Fi while at campus. Mobile data while at home is quite costly given these hard times.\u201d\n\nBy zero-rating the e-learning platforms, lecturers can upload study materials to the platforms at no data cost to enable students study for free while at home.\n\n\u201cOh my God, It\u2019s the best offer ever. You know how we lawyers read widely and heavily. I am sorted,\u201d Kwikiriza said hysterically. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing and very convenient. I can see their results and course work marks at any time without data worries.\u201d\n\nThis offer has seen many learners get out of their comfort zones and study despite the pandemic and lockdown. According to Trevor Ochom, a final year student of Education at Kyambogo University this offer is an answered prayer.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done, I know we shall have quite a marathon back at university once schools reopen. So the best way to keep up is by reading ahead while at home,\u201d says Ochom, noting that this offer makes studying while at home very easy. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need a laptop, a simple smartphone is enough. I appeal to fellow students to use their time at home productively.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kwikiriza, the content on the website is insightful and students have no excuse whatsoever when it comes to studying: \u201dI would totally recommend it to my coursemates and friends seeing as we need all the information we can get at the moment.\u201d\n\nMakerere University vice-chancellor Prof Barnabas Nawangwe has lauded MTN for this gesture saying it will go a long way in enabling students to catch up on lost study time as they will now have access to the study materials at no cost.\n\n\u201cOur negotiations with MTN Uganda yielded a lot of fruit as the telecom company has accepted to zero-rate six of our (Makerere University) online learning platforms. We applaud them for this. I now urge our students and lecturers to take advantage of this opportunity,\u201d said Prof Nawangwe when MTN first announced the offer, two weeks ago.\n\nMTN Uganda is dedicated to helping and impacting the communities positively and this is one of the ways the company is reaching out to students that may have a hard time accessing study materials on the internet because of financial constraints.", "link": "https://observer.ug/education/65158-students-embrace-e-learning-with-mtn-zero", "published": "2020-06-07T01:50:55+03:00"}, {"title": "Botswana schools reopen amid concerns over preparedness", "author": [], "text": "Students in Gaborone are checked for temperature before lessons start as part of new health regulations\n\nPublic schools in Botswana re-opened this week, after a two-month break due to COVID-19, but some remained closed as they failed to meet new safety requirements.\n\nThis week, Botswana reopened schools following the end of a seven-week lockdown on May 21.

It scared me about the state of our marriage; this Covid-19 lockdown has really taken a toll on us. He had never, ever done that. Not even in his sleep. And we had not set rules about it, either; it is just the way we rolled.\u201d\n\nIt is adorable to see a couple so comfortable about each other\u2019s presence, by the way. But getting too comfortable can also very easily be your downfall.\n\nJust because you have seen each other in the nude countless times, it does not mean throw away every excitement that comes with just a bit of imagination.

The problem is, you may realise that trouble when it is too late to repair the damage.\n\nThere is being comfortable and being just careless. Start now. You can sit on the toilet without her waiting for you on the bathtub; come on! You can cover your breasts as you walk around the house and still be sexy. You can be married and constantly in each other\u2019s faces, yet maintain some private spaces and mysterious aura.\n\nThat way, the sex \u2013 that time when you are at your most comfortable with each other\u2019s bodies and all the inexplicable actions \u2013 will benefit from the degree of anticipation and peculiarity you both still pack.\n\ncarol@observer.ug", "link": "https://observer.ug/lifestyle/65093-sex-talk-don-t-get-too-comfortable", "published": "2020-06-03T22:13:18+03:00"}, {"title": "Three is a crowd: Where can Diane put all this resentment?", "author": ["Margaret Wamanga"], "text": "David and Diane have been married for years; then there is Julie, the young secretary whose axis collides with the couple\u2019s in ways none of them saw coming.\n\n\n\nJULIE\n\nI had a restless night, tossing and turning with thoughts of David and Diane. When I woke up and there was no \u2018good morning\u2019 message from him, my mood only darkened.\n\nSince it was Sunday, he was no doubt going to be engaged with his family for the entire day and in a fit of rebellion, I decided to go and see my family as well. Of course that meant shopping for my mother; thanks to David, I had extra money on me and could afford to do so.\n\nEver since my mother had found out about my relationship with David, I had avoided her, hoping she would mellow with time, but I should have known better.\n\nShe welcomed me warmly enough, and received the shopping with gracious gratitude, but after we had made small talk for a while, she dove straight into the very subject I had been avoiding.\n\n\u201cHow is your friend? The married one,\u201d she added, in case I had any doubt about who she was referring to.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d I answered warily.\n\n\u201cAnd his wife? What about his family; are they fine too?\u201d\n\n\u201cMummy, do we really have to start with this again? I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time; can we just enjoy the afternoon without arguing?\u201d I pleaded.\n\n\u201cIf you were behaving like the decent, God-fearing woman I raised you to be, there would be no need for us to argue! As your mother, I can\u2019t see you going astray and say nothing!\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, now that you have told me your truth \u2013 that I\u2019m an immoral woman \u2013 can we change the subject?\u201d I snapped.\n\nI was not ready to be lectured about David by my mother. Probably sensing that I was quickly approaching the end of my tether, she dropped the subject, but not before she had gotten in a final ominous warning.\n\n\u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing, and that you\u2019re ready to deal with the consequences.\u201d\n\nDIANE\n\nI woke up a little after six the next morning; David was still fast asleep; so, I crept out of the bed as quietly as I could, so as not to wake him.\n\nWhile on the surface all had gone well last night, for me, the night had been an astounding failure, and I was not ready to face him yet.\n\nAfter a week apart, his confession, and my decision to forgive him, I had thought the sex would be amazing; a reaffirmation of our commitment to each other, and the mark of a fresh start. It had not come anywhere close to that!\n\nNot that there had been anything wrong with David\u2019s performance \u2013 he could be a skillful lover when he chose to, and last night, he clearly had \u2013 but all I could do was wonder if this was what he had done to that whore too.\n\nCould it be that he was imagining making love to her, rather than me? Although he thankfully did not call me by her name, not once did he mention mine either; so, it seemed like he was just going through the motions.\n\nOnce he was through, I rushed to the bathroom for another shower, feeling dirty and used, rather than loved and fulfilled. When I returned to the room, he was already asleep.\n\nDAVID\n\nIt was only seven when I woke up the next morning; so, I was surprised to find Diane\u2019s side of the bed empty, as she usually slept in on Sundays.\n\nBesides, last night had gone far better than I had hoped; not only had Diane forgiven me, we had wrapped up the night with fantastic sex; all the more reason for her to sleep late.\n\nAfter freshening up in the bathroom, I went downstairs and found her sitting at the kitchen island, a cup of coffee in her hands.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d I greeted her, with a quick peck on the cheek.\n\nTo my surprise and confusion, she visibly cringed at the touch, though she returned my greeting with a smile. I was about to ask about her negative physical reaction, but then decided to let it go, and pretend I had not noticed it.\n\n\u201cI was thinking we could take the children to the waterpark for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve called the maid to come back; so, I need to stay and wait for her, but you and the children go ahead. They\u2019ve missed you; so, it will be good for them to have some alone time with you.\u201d\n\nHer refusal made my confusion grow, because the maid had her own keys; so, she did not really need to wait for her. More than that, Diane had been so eager to have us resume our picture-perfect family, yet here she was making up bogus excuses, to avoid an outing I would expect her to be jumping at! What on earth was going on?\n\n\u201cDo you really have to be here in person when she comes? Can\u2019t she just let herself in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, she can, but I would rather be around. You go on with the children,\u201d she repeated insistently.\n\nI frowned in confusion, but after a few seconds, shrugged and let this go as well. Although she was certainly acting oddly, I could not really complain about spending time alone with the children.\n\n\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll do that; we\u2019ll leave after breakfast and get back at around six or so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds fine; should I pour you some coffee?\u201d she offered, as she stood up and moved off to the stove.\n\nI could not place my finger on what exactly it was, but the way she hurried to get out of my immediate space felt like she was uncomfortable in it, which did not make any sense at all.\n\nJust yesterday, she had freely given up her body to me, and now, it was like she could not bear to even be around me!\n\nmargaretwamanga@yahoo.com", "link": "https://observer.ug/lifestyle/65092-where-can-diane-put-all-this-resentment", "published": "2020-06-03T21:56:22+03:00"}, {"title": "2020 has really been apocalyptic", "author": ["Abdallah Mbajja"], "text": "When I was young, the year 2000 was supposed to change everything.

Again, nothing happened.\n\nSo, we all moved on from this fascination with specific years and their supposed importance. But then 2020 came along and forced us to consider the possibility that maybe the Mayans and the technological pessimists of the 20th century had it all wrong. Maybe 2020 is the year that every ridiculous conspiracy theory comes to fruition.\n\nThis year began with raging wildfires in Australia. Then came the horde of locusts.

And now the Snyder Cut is here.\n\nZack Snyder\u2019s seemingly mythical cut of 2017\u2019s Justice League has dominated pop culture discussions for years, generating more vitriol among fans and critics than any other subject besides Star Wars.\n\nWhat is the Snyder Cut?\n\nBefore BVS debuted in 2016, we learned that Warner Bros. was working on a two-part epic that would potentially rival Marvel\u2019s Avengers franchise.\n\nBut BVS debuted to less than positive reviews. Suicide Squad, which came out that same year, was equally reviled. In typical Warner Bros. fashion, the studio started revising its entire slate, eventually turning Snyder\u2019s two-part Justice League tale into a single movie.\n\nThe situation took a turn for the worst a year later when Snyder screened a rough cut of Justice League for Warner Bros. executives. They hated it.\n\nSnyder was sent back to the drawing board and tasked with making several changes. But then tragedy struck. Snyder\u2019s daughter committed suicide. Snyder left Justice League during the post-production process and Joss Whedon was called upon to finish the project.\n\nThe famed Avengers director was supposed to perform a few reshoots and administer the editorial process, which is why he is not credited as the director.\n\nBut in truth, Whedon reshot most of the movie, only using a quarter of Snyder\u2019s original footage. Justice League 2017 performed poorly at the box office. Everyone agreed it was a complete waste of the buildup that had begun with Man of Steel.\n\nNot long after, fans started petitioning WB to release Snyder\u2019s cut of the movie. WB ignored these calls. Movie pundits spent years arguing that the Snyder Cut did not exist, which only resulted in shouting matches.\n\nWell, we now know the Snyder Cut does not exist. But WB has Snyder\u2019s original footage. And they are reportedly giving him $30m to turn it into a real movie. Who saw this coming? No one. Fans spent years arguing that Snyder\u2019s version of Justice League would never see the light of day.

The online conversation never ends, and it keeps aggravating me.\n\nSo, let\u2019s discuss its predecessor, The Last of Us 1, specifically why it is so amazing. It is a fascinating combination of great storytelling and decent gameplay. The game kicks off with a bang, delivering one of the most breathtaking prologues I have ever encountered.\n\nThe immersive experience allows you to witness the literal end of the world. Then you skip a few years and things slow to a crawl. And by this point, you don\u2019t quite know why you should care about this gruff, rude, violent man and his seemingly petty quarrels.\n\nBut then you meet Ellie and everything changes. The relationship between Joel and Ellie sneaks up on you. Ellie never stops talking. She has an opinion on everything, while Joel does not want to engage.\n\nBut he can\u2019t help but chime in whenever this lonely child encounters a relic of the past that meant so much to him. Their relationship builds slowly and that is why the foundation is so strong.\n\nYou never get the sense that the game is forcing you to fall for this duo. But after a few hours, you can\u2019t help but feel like you know them not as characters, but as people.\n\nThe Last of Us isn\u2019t Resident Evil. Yes, the enemies are undead. But unlike Leon and his ilk, Joel is just a man, a relatively ordinary one. It does not take much to kill him.They say bonds are built through shared trials. The Last of Us does an amazing job allowing you to share in the nightmare of its protagonists. The Clickers are horrifying enemies.\n\nYou spend more time sneaking past them than you do killing them because most attempts at all-out combat end horribly.\n\nThe human enemies are no less terrifying, made more deadly by their overwhelming numbers and scarcity of your bullets. Unless you learn to jump from cover to cover, slitting throats in silence, you stand little chance of surviving this game.\n\nThe tension in The Last of Us is heart-stopping. Sidekicks in most games are annoying, because you have to carry them. They eventually become a bigger threat to your success than the enemy.\n\nEllie was a challenge at the start. She is a child, a victim, and it takes everything you have to keep her safe. However, she also gives the gamer the amazing opportunity to watch her grow.\n\nI distinctly remember the first time my opinion of the character changed. There I was, standing in a hallway, facing the barrel of a shotgun that was about to ruin all my progress. I had a knife but no real hope of closing the distance and using it.\n\nIn the second it took me to accept my death, a bottle flew over my head and exploded in the thug\u2019s face. Before he could even scream, a tiny figure leaped on his back and stabbed down at him with shocking aggression.\n\nAnd then he was dead. Ellie went on to save my life again and again, easily earning her place at the top of my list of most awesome sidekicks. The Last of Us is a perfect game with a cinematic narrative and the most intriguing pair of characters in gaming.\n\nmbjjnr8@gmail.com", "link": "https://observer.ug/lifestyle/65087-ellie-is-the-best-gaming-sidekick", "published": "2020-06-03T21:08:49+03:00"}, {"title": "With Masaka in charge, Namugongo was in for a Martyrs day like no other", "author": ["Sadab Kitatta Kaaya"], "text": "By March 18, when President Museveni announced a ban on religious gatherings to slow the spread of Covid-19, Masaka diocese was in advanced stages of preparations for this year\u2019s Martyrs day celebrations on June 3.\n\nAnd if stereotypes about \u2018banabuddu\u2019 and the number of Catholics in the sub-region are anything to go by, the Uganda Martyrs Shrine in Namugongo was set to be a beehive of activity and pomp today.\n\nAlso, given Masaka\u2019s position in the history of Catholicism in Uganda (one of the oldest Catholic churches in Uganda, Villa Maria, is in Buddu) the diocese was preparing for a Martyrs day like no other.\n\nAs the main organizer of this year\u2019s celebrations, the diocese had held a series of fundraising drives to raise the required funds \u2013 that is how the diocesan bishop, Rt Rev Serverus Jjumba ended up at Bank of Uganda and parliament, among other government and private institutions, meeting and leading the Catholic communities there in celebration of Mass.\n\nPreparations began on June 3, 2019, the day the diocese was announced as organisers of this year\u2019s celebrations. They started with assembling a choir by sending out invitations to all the parishes to send their best choristers. It is from that pool that a choir of about 400 was selected and it is this ensemble that has been practicing till early last month when it became evident that the prolonged Covid-19 lockdown would not allow the celebrations to happen.\n\nIf Namugongo last year received 1,300 foot pilgrims overall, this year, Masaka alone planned to bring at least 3,000 foot pilgrims. Mobilisation of these started on December 29, 2019, when the diocese embarked on a campaign to popularize the martyrs. For 22 weeks every Sunday, time was dedicated to each of the 22 Catholic martyrs.\n\n\u201cWe have been having a special prayer every Sunday, dedicating each Sunday since December to a martyr; sharing the life history of that particular martyr, how he ended up in the Kabaka\u2019s palace, his journey to Christianity and martyrdom,\u201d Fr Edward Ssekabanja, the Masaka diocesan Chancellor, told The Observer.\n\nAs they did all this, they also worked on a plan to decongest Namugongo. This entailed having a separate day for the youths \u2013 especially those in school.\n\n\u201cMasaka was all fired up for the day,\u201d Fr Ssekabanja said. \u201cWe planned to give the best, and that is how we came up with a plan to decongest Namugongo, which we hoped would be adopted for future celebrations.\u201d\n\nThe celebrations for students were to be held on May 29 with a hope that no school would send its learners for the main June 3 celebrations. To live up to their plan, a learners\u2019 martyrs day mass was celebrated last Friday at Kitovu cathedral where retired Bishop John Baptist Kaggwa had a small group of learners represent their colleagues in conformity with the social distancing guidelines.\n\nEarlier Martyrs Day celebrations\n\nAnd for the main celebrations today, the Uganda Episcopal Conference agreed that Catholics celebrate with bishops in their respective dioceses.

Bakasumba indicated that each senior officer was to receive Shs 120,000 while junior officers were to receive Shs 110,000 each for the 10 days.\n\nBakashumba sent the money to the respective stations where the officers are attached. The money had also been distributed according to the number of police officers attached to the task forces from every station.\n\nHowever, three days after the money had been disbursed, police officers complained that they had been ordered to sign for Shs 50,000 while others were told to sign for Shs 70,000 instead of the full amount.\n\nIt is claimed the number of shortchanged officers had reached 700.

From a legal perspective, I find this ministerial directive illegal, irrational, and fundamentally unfair. Here\u2019s why.\n\nILLEGALITY\n\nFirst and foremost, the directive is not an enforceable rule in law. Pursuant to section 57(d) of the Education Act 2008, the minister of Education and Sports may, by statutory instrument, make regulations for the management and control of private schools.\n\nClearly, the Act forbids the minister or her subordinates from using arbitrary letters, directives, guidelines, circulars, speeches, press statements or other documents by whatever name called to regulate the affairs of a private education institutions.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s rule-making authority in relation to private schools can only be lawfully invoked by the Education minister through a gazetted statutory instrument as defined in Part IV of the Interpretation Act.\n\nTherefore, Kakooza\u2019s directive not only usurped the rule-making powers exclusively vested in his line minister, but it was also not dressed up in the prescribed format. It is therefore blatantly illegal, null and void.\n\nSecondly, even it were viewed as a matter of policy, the permanent secretary\u2019s directive is plainly inconsistent with section 40(2)(a) the Employment Act 2006 and Article 26 of the Constitution. It is, to that extent, illegal, null and void.\n\nWhereas under section 5(1)(n) of the Education Act 2008 the education ministry is responsible for development of management policies for private schools, this power must be exercised in accordance with existing laws such as the Employment Act 2006 and the Constitution. In other words the ministry\u2019s policy-making authority in relation to private schools is neither absolute nor unqualified.\n\nIn relation to wages of teachers and other staff in private schools, the ministry\u2019s policies must be consistent with Part V of the Employment Act 2006.\n\nSection 40(2)(a) of the Employment Act 2006 releases an employer from the obligation to provide work and wages where the employment contract has been frustrated.\n\nFrustration is a legal doctrine which describes a situation where contractual terms and obligations, such as the employer\u2019s duty to provide work and the employees\u2019 entitlement to wages, cannot be fulfilled due to an event not contemplated by the parties and to which neither contributed.\n\nThe public health measures invoked by government to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic starting on March 18, 2020 totally frustrated all employment contracts in the education sector which was deemed non-essential, except in the limited circumstances where some school owners were able to negotiate for the continuity of service by select staff or otherwise find alternative useful employment for the affected workers.\n\nSchools may remain closed for a substantial period of time and employers may be unable to utilize the services of all teachers and other staff who were gainfully employed before pandemic. Why should they be forced to continue providing remuneration to employees from whom they expect no work to bedone during this period of uncertainty?\n\nAgainst this background the ministry\u2019s policy directive, if we may call it that, unjustifiably ignores the doctrine of frustration of employment contracts and is tantamount to a hostile takeover of assets of private school owners to fulfill a populist agenda of government without prior payment of prompt and adequate compensation, contrary to Article 26 of the Constitution.\n\nThis must shock our conscience as a nation that is yet to heal from the wounds of President Idi Amin\u2019s populist expropriation of Asian properties in 1972. Are we going to let history repeat itself?\n\nIrrationality\n\nIn issuing this directive, the ministry unreasonably combined like and unlike terms, as if it were oblivious of the four different categories of education institutions provided for under section 6 the Education Act 2008, namely public education institutions or government-funded institutions, government grant-aided education institutions, private institutions which shall include profit and nonprofit making entities, and non-formal education centres.\n\nWhereas the wage bill in some of these institutions is fulfilled through government grants and subventions drawn from the consolidated fund, private institutions do not enjoy this privilege.\n\nThe directive is therefore devoid of logic insofar as it purports to impose a one-size-fits-all approach to education financing which is not only impracticable, but also insulting to private school owners who must painstakingly mobilise operational funds from a limited range of sources and usually on very onerous terms and conditions.\n\nFurthermore, the directive was disingenuously conceptualized and is intended to serve an extraneous purpose outside the mandate and capacity of the ministry of education and sports, namely, the provision of basic social security to workers whose services the government itself has deemed non-essential during this crisis.\n\nWhile nearly all sectors of the economy have been hard-hit by the government\u2019s brutal lockdown measures, a stimulus package is yet to be offered to school owners in the private sector to help them fulfill the government agenda of appeasing non-essential workers furloughed by the pandemic.\n\nIt is preposterous for government to insist that employers must convert their pre-pandemic wage budget allocations into an impromptu social security fund.\n\nWhy should the government force private sector employers in Uganda to be compassionate towards furloughed employees yet in Kenya, for instance, lockdown wages have been funded by the government?\n\nThe government has been busy borrowing from the East and from the West, piling up the sovereign debt ostensibly to provide social security and stabilize the economy.\n\nTrillions of shillings have been rapidly withdrawn from the national treasury ostensibly to serve the same purpose. It is therefore extremely hurtful that government is trying to abdicate its overarching obligations by intimidating and harassing private sector employers to carry its water. Have we now resorted to governance by shakedown?\n\nFundamentally unfair\n\nContrary to established principles of good governance, the impugned directive was not preceded by fair and adequate consultation with the relevant stakeholders, and is therefore devoid of any legitimacy or legal force. It is a half-hearted knee-jerk reaction that should be treated with the contempt it deserves.\n\nIn sum, the state\u2019s historical failure to take adequate steps for the progressive realization of the rights to disaster relief and basic social security for all, including unemployed Ugandans, should not be used as an excuse to exploit and harass private sector employers during this crisis.\n\nThe author specialises in public law and human rights, and is the executive director of Legal Brains Trust, a Kampala based democracy and human rights watchdog.", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65076-ministry-directive-on-wages-in-private-schools-is-illegal", "published": "2020-06-03T16:40:47+03:00"}, {"title": "Withhold tax on payments made for purchase of business or asset", "author": ["Ann Barnshaw Kengaaju"], "text": "Simply explained withholding tax is a form of income tax deducted at source by the person making the payment on which the withholding tax is imposed.\n\nIn Uganda, a resident person who purchases a business or a business asset is obliged under the law to withhold tax on the gross payment made for the business or business asset purchased.\n\nIn other words, the purchaser is designated a withholding tax agent by law. A business asset is an asset which is used or held ready for use in a business and includes any asset held for sale in a business and any asset of a partnership or a company.\n\nSo, a business asset may include, among others, furniture, land, computers, motor vehicles or a financial contract. As stated above, any payments made for the purchase of an asset owned by a partnership or a company are automatically subject to withholding tax.\n\nHowever, where a resident person purchases a business asset from a taxable person other than a partnership or a company, say for example from an individual or a trust, it is pertinent to ascertain whether the asset is used or held ready for use or for sale in a business.\n\nOn the other hand, a business is any trade, profession, vocation or adventure in the nature of trade other than employment. So a business would include among others, a hardware store, carpentry shop, supermarket or consultancy firm.\n\nTherefore, should one purchase a business whether from a resident individual, company, partnership or trust, one is required to withhold tax on the gross payment paid. The withholding tax is charged at rate of 6 per cent and it should be withheld at the point of making the payment, whether cash or in kind for the business or business asset.\n\nIn case the payment is made in instalments, the withholding agent should withhold 6 per cent on each installment paid. Upon withholding the tax, the withholding tax agent must file a withholding tax return indicating the details of the payee (seller), gross amount paid for the business or business asset, the date of payment, nature of payment, the tax rate and the amount withheld.\n\nThis return is to be filed not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the payment was made. Should the purchaser intentionally or unintentionally fail to file the return by the due date, he or she will be liable to pay a penalty for late filing.\n\nAs tempting as it maybe to use the withheld money for personal use, it is necessary to remember that as a withholding tax agent, one holds that money in trust for the Government of Uganda.\n\nIn other words, it is not one\u2019s money and so upon filing the return, one ought to remit the withheld amount to Uganda Revenue Authority by the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the purchase price was paid.\n\nAs always, failure to remit tax by the due date attracts a penalty and its first cousin, interest and trust these two to cause a business as formidable and seemingly indestructible as the Titanic to sink. Upon filing the withholding tax return, the withholding tax agent is obliged to generate and deliver a tax credit certificate to the payee.\n\nHowever, in Uganda it is survival for the fittest so most likely the agent may not deliver the tax credit certificate and so the payee may have to follow up with the latter to obtain it. In some instances, a purchaser may buy a business or a business asset from a withholding tax exempt person in which case the latter need not withhold the said 6% from the gross payment made for the purchase.\n\nHowever, it is not a matter of assuming or relying on hearsay, the purchaser ought to diligently ascertain that the seller\u2019s name appears on the withholding tax exemption list for that particular period.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the tax withheld is not a final tax and so its payment does not extinguish the parties\u2019 tax obligation(s) regarding the said transaction.\n\nFor instance if the transaction relates to the sale of land as a business asset, the fact that the purchaser withheld 6 per cent on the gross payment of the purchase price neither extinguishes his or her obligation to pay stamp duty nor the seller\u2019s obligation to report and remit capital gains tax if any.\n\nThis tax is merely an advance tax payment for the payee (seller) of the business or business asset and it may only be used to reduce the latter\u2019s income tax liability.\n\nWhile filing the final income tax return which is generally due to be filed not later than six months after the end of that year of income, the payee ought to indicate details of the withholding tax agent, gross amount paid to the payee and the date of payment, the tax credit certificate number, and the tax credit to be able to utilise that credit to reduce its income tax liability for that year of income.\n\nTherefore, tax payers should at all times keep record of the tax withheld to ensure among others that the evidence of tax paid is readily available in case of any tax audits or credit claims and also to avoid claiming the credit more than once.\n\nThe law specifically requires tax payers to retain records for five years of income following the year of income to which the records relate. With that said and as we ask government to help us during these unprecedented tough times, let us also help ourselves by complying with the law(s).\n\nAfter all we joyfully voted for the parties who passed these laws. So let us respect our votes by withholding tax on gross payments made for a business or business asset, filing the tax return and remitting the tax on time.", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65118-withhold-tax-on-payments-made-for-purchase-of-business-or-asset", "published": "2020-06-03T16:32:54+03:00"}, {"title": "Old taxi park redevelopment can be done better", "author": ["Dan Kangave"], "text": "Government\u2019s plan, through Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), to redevelop the Old Taxi Park is good news for public transport.\n\nSince May 13, Sterling Civil Engineering Ltd and Kiru General Services Ltd, the firms contracted to do the redevelopment, have razed down all the old structures to pave way for the construction of new one. In fact, this has been long overdue, given the years of chaos in this taxi park.\n\nThe redevelopment is expected to improve passenger access to the park, ease traffic and control taxi operation in Kampala\u2019s Central Business District (CDB).\n\nSqueezed between the busiest parts of the city (such as Kikuubo and St Balikuddembe market in downtown Kampala) and several shopping arcades along Luwum Street as well as Nakasero market, the Old park has for long been associated with chaos and traffic congestion.\n\nAccording to the plan, the redeveloped Old Park will have improved lighting to ensure safety and some shades for passengers. The park will have designated entry and exit points for both vehicles and pedestrians.\n\nThis will ease access and control of vehicles to avoid queuing on the surrounding roads and congestion within the park. For organised parking dermacation, and to avoid the muddy flooding whenever it rains, KCCA officials said the contractor will lay an artificial carpet in the park. The new carpet will have markings to delineate areas for parking, taxis and pedestrian movement.\n\nBoundaries of the park will be retained to prevent mud from washing onto the carpet. The park will also house sanitary facilities such as toilets, showers; include an administration block and a police post. Toilets should be state of art.\n\nPolice should have better detention facilities. On funding, the government should not contribute to limit state interference and allow the independence of the management of the park. Instead, funding should be from KCCA and other parastatals. The religious fraternity and also the public can also be allowed to buy shares in the company that will be managing the park.\n\nAlso, the management of the park should be led by highly-qualified people and of high integrity. All the above will be very good improvements on the facility.\n\nOnce implemented the safety, security of passengers and less traffic congestion could be guaranteed. However, the city authority can do better, and here\u2019s how. First, consider building a storied structure with different entries for taxis into the park. A storied structure will create more space for not only the passengers and taxis but also for other amenities.\n\nSecondly, the city authority can create income-generating facilities such as shops, restaurants, saloons, clinics and others for rent. Or it can call out government agencies or individuals to either buy shares or lease such facilities for proper business operation. Non-government institutions such as Buganda Kingdom, UTODA and others in the religious fraternity should be highly considered if they show interest in getting involved as funders or investors.\n\nThirdly, while the ongoing redevelopment is expected to decongest the sorrounding areas, it certainly will not match the ever-growing traffic in that particular part of the city.\n\nSo, the option of building flyovers and electric (cable) cars should be top of KCCA\u2019s to-do list. Finally, I appreciate the inclusion of a police post and toilets in the plan being implemented but the new facilities should be of international standards.\n\nFor example, the police post should have a better section for detainees as opposed to the current ones we see around the country with squeezed cages to hold more than hundred suspects!\n\nThe author is a retired civil servant 0772 522365", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65117-old-taxi-park-redevelopment-can-be-done-better", "published": "2020-06-03T16:23:48+03:00"}, {"title": "NSSF bill brings out crucial role of MPs", "author": ["Mohammed Katamba", "Pironga Bonnie James"], "text": "Yet another controversial and emotional debate is coming out of parliament.\n\nThis time it is about the proposal or push by some members of parliament to have a portion of savers in the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) access a fraction of their savings with the fund to cushion them from effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic has seen virtually everything in the country and the world come to a standstill - with interruptions to travel, tourism, business, education to family, work and feeding.\n\nSome employers have cut salaries, sent workers on forced or unpaid leave or laid them off all together. With such happenings, people will look towards the savings they have stashed up for themselves somewhere as their source of salvation during such critical times as these.\n\nThis proposal for mid-term access to savings is one of the many contained in the National Social Security Fund (Amendment) Bill, 2019. The bill seeks to, among other things, provide for midterm access to voluntary contributions and to expand social security coverage by providing for mandatory contribution of all workers regardless of the size of the enterprise or number of employees.\n\nIt also allows for voluntary contributions to the fund, and seeks to empower the fund to recover from a third party any sum owed to a defaulting contributing employer to cover any contribution, penalty or interest.\n\nRichard Byarugaba, the managing director of the National Social Security Fund, argues that there are no ready funds to dish out to savers, as much of the collections are invested in government securities and real estate. He says that recalling the funds hurriedly would cause a loss to the fund and will, in turn, hurt the economy.\n\nIn parliament, MPs led by Worker\u2019s representatives argue that the fund must help its members in this trying moment. The debate comes right at the time when the House Committee on Finance is considering the amendment to the NSSF Act, and at the opportune moment when almost everyone is locked at home following a government directive intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nSavers have written to their representatives giving their own arguments and voicing their urgent need for help. Legislators represent views of the people and legislate or make laws for the \u201cpeace, order, development and good governance of Uganda.\u201d\n\nThe debate on the NSSF (Amendment) Bill is just one such legislation, coming at the very time when hundreds of savers and, by extension, their dependants need assistance.\n\nThe discussion on the bill clearly highlights the need for MPs, parliament and their role(s). Further, with several Ugandans stuck abroad during this same period, MPs have called on government to take measures to return them home. Several of them have reached out to their members, who have presented their concerns to Parliament and called on government to act.\n\nFor different reasons, many are unable to return home despite their wish as several countries including Uganda have closed their borders and more or less suspended passenger flights.\n\nSpeaker Rebecca Kadaga, who said she was also called by international artiste, Eddy Kenzo, who is stuck in Ivory Coast, has asked government to make a statement to parliament showing how the Ugandans stuck abroad but wish to return will be helped.\n\nAll this signifies the importance of parliament and the need for the institution to have remained open despite the lockdown, which affected both government and the private sectors. Who, for example, would handle these two issues (and several others) if parliament had yielded to public pressure and closed its doors?\n\nThe issues would certainly be considered, but this would probably be at an unknown date. Would the public have been happier and ready to wait?\n\nDespite our anger, the hunger and the disappointment and frustration with some actions of our legislators, let us not forget that in the midst of challenges, MPs and parliament still carry out an important constitutional duty in the country.\n\nAlso, that one can always reach out to them to present one\u2019s views and petitions, all of which will be properly considered, according to the law.\n\nJust these two issues that seem to have affected hundreds of people, some directly while others indirectly, and which must be handled by legislators show the significance of parliament, (at all times and more so in a period of crisis like the current pandemic and associated government restrictions) which for some reasons is questioned by many during times of controversy.\n\nThe author works at the Parliament of Uganda.", "link": "https://observer.ug/viewpoint/65114-nssf-bill-brings-out-crucial-role-of-mps", "published": "2020-06-03T14:51:53+03:00"}, {"title": "Covid-19 and Uganda\u2019s border: time to shut it down!", "author": ["Bruce Tumwine Rwabasonga"], "text": "In the last couple of days, more cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Uganda \u2013 most of them being diagnosed among truck drivers that were crossing the border.\n\nAssuming a basic reproduction number of greater than one as seen in other countries, these new cases can potentially exponentially grow into thousands of new cases across the country over the coming weeks. This brings up an existential question for the country: how can Uganda ensure that it doesn\u2019t lose the tide in the fight against COVID-19 due to a porous border while ensuring flow of essential goods?\n\nThe simple answer to this existential question is to \u2018shut down the border for now!\u2019 The case for this answer is further made by the fact that taking full measures to limit movement within its borders has resulted in no documented community-spread cases in the last couple of weeks despite significant testing across the country.\n\nSo, why not institute the same successful measure especially given the sacrifices that the entire population is making to stay under lockdown? Unfortunately, as a landlocked country that doesn\u2019t manufacture its essential goods, Uganda doesn\u2019t have this luxury. While a full border lockdown isn\u2019t possible, there is more that the government can do to ensure continued flow of these essential goods while ensuring public safety.\n\nCredit to the government, a number of changes were instituted including mandating truck drivers to show a negative COVID-19 test result before being allowed into the country as well as use a contact-tracing app. However, these measures seem a tad insufficient to address this existential threat to Ugandan lives.\n\nSo, what else can the country do? Long term, just as many countries are using this unprecedented time to do a reset, this is an opportune time for Uganda to consider building internal essential goods manufacturing capacity. This intervention, in addition, to ensuring that there aren\u2019t shortages of essential goods, will in the long term boost its economy.\n\nThe COVID-19 funding from partners might offer potential seed funding to initiate this intervention. In addition to this long-term change, some short-term changes are needed to ease this existential threat. One of the easier-to-implement changes is, just like people\u2019s movement has been severely limited, to limit cross-border transportation of goods during this period to just the essential goods.\n\nThe scanty data available on this shows that the volume of goods transported across the border hasn\u2019t significantly decreased compared to the pre-lockdown levels.\n\nSecondly, trucking and long-distance hauling companies, just like hospitals have done, need to institute, demonstrate and inform the public about the measures and processes they are taking to protect the general public lest they be required to cease operations during this time.\n\nThese processes and measures, in addition to existing ones, could potentially include switching drivers at the immigration borders, limiting driver interactions with the public as much as possible and partnering with government to implement and adhere to additional ones that might be issued.\n\nJust like in medicine, truck drivers and their current role as Uganda\u2019s COVID-19 Trojan horse are but a mere symptom of a more sinister diagnosis \u2013 minimally coordinated COVID-19 responses amongst Uganda and its neighbouring countries. While Uganda has heeded the experts and, through impressively well-coordinated efforts, managed to take full measures and contain the spread of the virus within its borders, its neighbours have instituted varying interventions with varying success in COVID-19 containment.\n\nUnfortunately, in this situation as the USA learnt in its COVID-19 response and later demonstrated information of regional alliances amongst states, it doesn\u2019t matter how impressively contained the virus is in one of the countries as people will always find a way to move across an invisible border that can\u2019t truly be shut down.\n\nUltimately, Uganda needs to build functional regional alliances with its neighbours and ensure alignment in their COVID-19 responses through the use of diplomacy and economic incentives and whatever else it might take. As the Pareto rule states, roughly 80 per cent of the outcomes come from 20 per cent of the causes.\n\nIn Uganda\u2019s COVID-19 war, as reported daily, the battle within Uganda\u2019s borders has been won thus far with extremely few community-spread cases. The eminent threat in this war is from its borders and more specifically truck drivers that, at no fault of their own, have become Uganda\u2019s Trojan horse.\n\nHow Uganda addresses this issue over the coming days will determine if the country\u2019s COVID-19 outcomes become a success story for the rest of the world or not.

In response, the Assistant Registrar explained that he does most of the ADR sessions assisted by a religious leader from Hoima resulting in a completion of 128 cases in the same period.\n\nThe legislators advised that given the plurality of our society, it is important for the Court to involve religious leaders from different faith and civic leaders representing the different interests in society in ADR to avoid complaints of bias and to raise confidence in the process.\n\nThey also recommended training of mediators both within and without the legal sector to increase the capacity of the court in dealing with cases outside the traditional mechanism of adjudication, which is time consuming, slow and costly.\n\nThe Judiciary was urged to operationalise the Registry of Mediation and give its own staff to concentrate on ADR, instead of relying on judicial officers who are over burdened with adjudication and over worked.\n\nOn the Chain Linked Programme, the MPs wanted to know how the court and the Office of the DPP were working together to reduce criminal case backlog, particularly in weeding out unmeritorious cases and speeding up trials.\n\nThey were informed that the Masindi Chain Linked Programme was last year recognised by JLOS as the best performing DCC in the country.\n\nThe MPs were informed that because of the Chain Linked Programme, the Masindi Chief Magistrates\u2019 Court has only 75 backlogged criminal cases.\n\nOn reducing case backlog, the lawmakers recommended that the jurisdiction of Magistrates should be enhanced to relieve the High Court of some cases.\n\nIt was proposed that the jurisdiction of the Chief Magistrate should be increased from Shs50 million to Shs200 million to suit the current economic realities.\n\nThe Judicial Officers were advised to prepare cases adequately before going to court since early and efficient preparation of cases is essential to the timely disposal of cases.\n\nOn improving the terms and conditions of service for administrative staff , the MPs said they were going to petition the Ministry of Public Service to improve salaries of administrative staff to match the enhanced salaries of judicial officers.\n\nOn addressing gender equality, they advised the Judiciary to use the electronic media to sensitize the public about the evils of gender based violence and inequality in society.\n\nAs a means of ensuring self-sustenance and growth, judicial officers were advised to engage in economic activities instead of only waiting for salary and enhanced retirement benefits. It was noted that expanding the economic wellbeing of judicial officers would reduce incidents of corruption in the administration of justice.\n\nThe Resident Judge thanked the legislators for finding time to interact with the Judiciary at the grassroots where justice matters matter most to the common person.\n\nComments", "link": "https://www.pmldaily.com/news/2020/06/mps-express-concern-on-level-of-case-backlog-as-they-visit-masindi-high-court.html", "published": "2020-06-13T05:48:02+00:00"}, {"title": "2020/21 FUFA Big League to kick-off on October 29 \u2013 PML Daily", "author": [], "text": "MENGO \u2013 Just days after meeting Uganda Premier League clubs, the Federation of Uganda Football Associations (FUFA) held another consultative meeting on Friday, June 12.\n\nThe meeting which was also held at FUFA House in Mengo, was with teams playing in the FUFA Big League.\n\nThe meeting chaired by FUFA President Moses Magogo in the presence of some FUFA Executive Committee members hinged on three key salient issues that included; how best clubs can brand themselves to suit modern trends, club licensing activity calendar and the proposed FUFA Competitions reforms.\n\nProposed action plan for FUFA Big League Club Licensing\n\n-FUFA Consultative meeting with clubs \u2013 12th June, 2020\n\n-Release of Club licensing regulations \u2013 22nd June, 2020\n\n-Clubs express interest to participate in the 2020/2021 season \u2013 23rd\u2013 26th June, 2020\n\n-First phase of the Clubs Pro Agenda \u2013 1st\u2013 10th July 2020\n\n-Submit Clubs\u2019 License application and all supporting documents \u2013 13th\u2013 24th July 2020\n\n-First review and decision by First Instance Body-FIB (Club Licensing Committee) \u2013 27th -29th July 2020\n\n-First inspection of clubs\u2019 facilities \u2013 6th -13th August 2020\n\n-End submission and uploading of Players\u2019 documents on FIFA Connect System& Domestic Transfer Matching System (DTMS) \u2013 14th August 2020\n\n-Second review and decision by First Instance Body-FIB (Club Licensing Committee) \u2013 17th August 2020\n\n-Second Inspection of facilities \u2013 4th September 2020\n\n-Final decision by appeals body \u2013 7th -11th September 2020\n\n-Release of final list of successful clubs \u2013 14th September 2020\n\n-Release of fixtures -29th September 2020\n\n-Kick-off of 2020/2021 FUFA Big League \u2013 29th October 2020\n\nWhat they said\n\nMoses Magogo, FUFA President\n\n\u201cI take this opportunity to thank everyone that has attended this meeting. We appreciate your efforts towards developing the game of football. This meeting is aimed at evaluating ourselves, see how far we have moved but also know where we are going. For long we have dwelled on the sporting ground but we should be thinking about the other elements like governance and looking at the business side of football.\n\n\u201cAs football, we have failed to realize the potential we have and how best we can tap into sponsorship monies. There are very many teams in the FUFA Big League that can embrace the community sense of belonging because you have huge but dormant fan bases. We need to play the game of numbers because a sponsor doesn\u2019t look at how you spend but rather the value you give. The brand of the Big League is as strong as the clubs and that is what we must do and that is why we insist that instead of giving you the fish, we should give you the net to get more fish.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the situation gets better and have these games played. As FUFA, we want promotion to be on sporting grounds and that is why we are still buying more time. However, this will depend on the guidelines given by the Ministry of Health.\u201d\n\nFUFA 1st Vice President, Justus Mugisha.\n\n\u201cWhen we brought the Juniors League in 2015, majority of the clubs in the Uganda Premier League saw it as a burden but for some who put emphasis on their teams have benefited. For instance, look at KCCA FC, they have been promoting players from their Junior team into the senior team and yet maintaining their standards in competing for titles.\u201d\n\nKataka FC Vice chairman, Hassan Kakaire Kirunda\n\n\u201cI thank FUFA for the interaction we have had today, it has been fruitful and I propose that going forward, we should have such meeting often\u2019 said Kirunda whose proposal was welcomed and an agreement was reached to have quarterly meetings between FUFA and the clubs\u2019 management top brass.\u201d\n\nPaul Mark Kayongo, Chairman of Ndejje University FC\n\n\u201cI thank FUFA for the meeting. I believe it was a good gesture in boosting stakeholders\u2019 confidence. What I request is for FUFA to make emphasis on the principles and revisit the existing FUFA Big League guidelines and see how teams can improve.\u201d\n\nGilbert Nyaika, Kitara FC\n\n\u201cFor the time I have been at Kitara FC, I think this is the first meeting we have had with FUFA at this level. It is important that FUFA gets to know our challenges as clubs and definitely such meetings are going to help.\u201d\n\nFUFA 2nd Vice President, Darius Mugoye\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to report that I have observed the FUFA Big League for some time and I can say there is more football than politicking. If only clubs can employ the right human resource, then development and growth of clubs will be realized.\u201d\n\nFUFA Club Licensing Chairman, Rogers Mulindwa\n\n\u201cClub licensing is the kitchen of football across the world. Governance, financial stability and standards are very key. We need to move together with owners, leaders and technical staff to develop the game. The action plan is well laid out and ready to start.\u201d\n\nOn the proposed FUFA Competitions reforms, in particular the playing format, members made various contributions on the matter but were later given an opportunity for further extensive discussion and report back on the agreed position.\n\nEach of the 16 teams playing in the FUFA Big League will have a Junior League team, playing in the regional league where the particular team is based.\n\nThe aforementioned reforms are supposed to come into effect for the 2021/2022 season with next season (2020/2021) acting as a transition period.\n\nComments", "link": "https://www.pmldaily.com/sports/2020/06/2020-21-fufa-big-league-to-kick-off-on-october-29.html", "published": "2020-06-20T00:00:00"}, {"title": "BREAKING!

But, they were made to work for thier 1-0 win over Hertha Berlin last week. And with just four matches remaining, Lucien Favre\u2019s men could potentially hand Bayern Munich the league title if they fail to secure a win against Fortuna Dusseldorf.\n\nDusseldorf have been among the most unpredictable sides in the Bundesliga this season. They are yet to perform consistently since the return of the league and are dawdling at the bottom end of the league table, just three points ahead of relegation-threatened Werder Bremen.\n\nDie Flingeraner were given a 5-0 drubbing the last time these two sides met. And given the way they have defended this season, Dusseldorf are once again expected to struggle against a Dortmund side which has scored 81 goals in the league so far.\n\nLong-term absentee Zack Steffen remains sidelined for Dusseldorf, while Marcel Sobottka and Bernard Tekpetey are also doubtful. Adam Bodzek is suspended after picking up his 10th yellow card of the season last weekend, and Rosler may opt to switch to a back four as Dusseldorf prepare for a challenging afternoon.\n\nHummels will almost certainly slot back in to the Dortmund defence as the German returns from suspension, meaning that last week\u2019s match-winner Can will likely make way. Erling Braut Haaland is also facing a race to be fit after missing the last two games with a knee injury, but the forward has returned to training and could play a part here. Marco Reus is also making good progress with his recovery but will not feature for this one, and Nico Schulz, Dan-Axel Zagadou and Mahmoud Dahoud all remain out for Favre\u2019s side. Should Haaland make the first XI for this tie, the forward could be supported by Sancho and Julian Brandt in attack with Thorgan Hazard dropping to the bench\n\nBayern Munich vs Borussia Monchengladbach\n\nAllianz Arena, Munich\n\nSaturday, 13-06-2020 @7:30pm\n\nBayern will look to edge closer to winning the Bundesliga as they welcome Borussia Monchengladbach to the Allianz Arena on Saturday.\n\nThe Bavarians led by Hansi Flick, has been pretty much unstoppable since December and will be able to put an end to the Bundesliga title race if Borussia Dortmund drop points against Fortuna Dusseldorf earlier in the day.\n\nTheir last defeat came against none other than Borussia Monchengladbach, after which they have gone on a 21-game unbeaten run.\n\nThe race for the title had gone on to become rather chaotic, but Bayern pretty much wrapped it up against Dortmund in Der Klassiker, registering a 1-0 win. After a roller-coaster of a season, we have reached a very predictable end.\n\nGladbach, however, are very much alive in the exciting competition for a Champions League spot, with seven points separating Der BVB in second and them in fourth. But, they are on the same number of points as Bayer Leverkusen who stand 5th and could be in with a chance to gain some advantage over Die Fohlen.\n\nThe champions-elect traveled to Leverkusen last week and dismantled Die Werkself at their own home, putting four past Lukas Hradecky and conceding twice, once very early in the game and the other very late. Gladbach, on the other hand, are coming off a very disappointing display from last week after tasting defeat at the hands of Freiburg.\n\nTheyshould have been their moment to draw level on points with RB Leipzig, who are third at the moment with 59 points. Marco Rose\u2019s men will be looking to use this game to record a double over Bayern, who might be tired after their midweek clash against Eintracht Frankfurt in the semi-finals of the DFB Pokal.\n\nSerge Gnabry missed out Bayern\u2019s cup victory in midweek with a bruised back, and it remains to be seen whether the 24-year-old will be passed fit for the visit of Monchengladbach. Bayern will already have to do without Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller, both of whom are suspended for this fixture having picked up bookings last weekend. Gnabry\u2019s potential absence opens up a spot for Ivan Perisic to start out wide, while the young Joshua Zirkzee could be given a chance to lead the line for Bayern.\n\nMonchengladbach have also suffered losses in the attacking department following Alassane Plea\u2019s red card in the defeat to Freiburg. However, Breel Embolo is an option for Rose after the forward made his return to training, while Raffael has also overcome a minor ankle problem. Denis Zakaria, Fabian Johnson and Tobias Strobl all remain on the treatment table for Monchengladbach.\n\nIn Robert Lewandowski (30 goals, three assists) and Thomas Muller (seven goals, 20 assists), Bayern Munich will be without the two players responsible for 66 per cent of their Bundesliga goals this season. Hansi Flick has won 23 of his first 26 competitive games as Bayern coach, two more than Pep Guardiola won across the same period at the club. Bayern Munich have scored 90 goals from 30 games this term, more than any other team at the same stage in the league\u2019s history. Borussia Monchengladbach have prevailed in three of their last five meetings with Bayern Munich. Ramy Bensebaini \u2013 with his only Bundesliga brace \u2013 sealed a 2-1 win for the Foals with a stoppage-time penalty in the reverse fixture. Lars Stindl has been directly involved in a goal in five of his seven games against Bayern Munich with Gladbach (three goals, two assists).

Highly-coveted centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly sat out the first leg but the Senegal international should make the starting lineup for this one.\n\nDaniele Padelli will be unavailable for Inter through suspension, but the 34-year-old was never likely to trouble Samir Handanovic for a spot in goal. Alexis Sanchez has recovered from an ankle problem and is available for selection, but the strike partnership of Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez seems the most likely option from the first whistle.

African brands only occupy 13 of the 100 entries, seven less from last year.\n\nEstablished 10 years ago, to coincide with the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the world\u2019s biggest single sporting event, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands survey and rankings have established themselves as the most authoritative survey, analysis, and metric of brands in Africa.\n\nAfrican brands only occupied 13 of the 100 entries, 7 less from last year\u2019s.\n\nFounder and Chairman of Brand Africa and Brand Leadership, Thebe Ikalafeng during an online interactive session via Zoom said: \u201cAfrican brands have an important role in helping to build the image, competitiveness and transforming the continent\u2019s promise into a real change. It\u2019s concerning that in the 10 years since the triumphant FIFA World Cup in South Africa which globally highlighted the promise and capability of Africa, and despite the vibrant entrepreneurial environment, Africa is not creating more competitive brands to meet the needs of its growing consumer market.\u201d\n\nGlobal Client Development Manager, GeoPoll, Caitlin van Niekerk said: \u201cThe reach and accessibility of mobile across the continent enabled us to survey respondents across a representative sample of countries quickly and effectively, giving us vital and timely results at a critical time. Kantar has been the insight lead for Brand Africa since inception in 2010.\u201d\n\nIt is a consumer-led survey that seeks to establish brand preferences across Africa. The survey is conducted among a representative sample of respondents 18 years and older, in 27 countries which collectively represent 50 percent of the continent, covering all economic regions and accounting for an estimated 80 percent of the population and the GDP of Africa. The 2020 survey was conducted between February and April 2020 and yielded over 15,000 brand mentions and over 2,000 unique brands\n\nOut of the top 100 brands in 2010/11, only half still appear in this year\u2019s list due to mergers, acquisitions, and the obsolescence of many brands. The most prominent changes are in the technology category with the demise Blackberry (#32 in 2010/11), the consolidation of Vodafone (#54 in 2010/11 and now #13 in 2020) which acquired Vodacom in 2008 and re-branded in 2011, Etisalat (#40 in 2010/11) re-branding to 9 Mobile in 2017 and Motorola (#39) being acquired by Lenovo in 2014. A Chinese brand, Tecno, has raced up the ranking from #33 to #5 in the rankings \u2013 a dominant performance for one of China\u2019s premier global brands that are not even sold in China\n\nIn his reaction, Group Chief Corporate Communication Officer of the Dangote Group, Anthony Chiejina said the management was not unexpected to the ranking because the company has a long-standing reputation for quality, relevance compliance, and social stewardship. \u201cOur mission and vision engage and inspire us to buy extension connect us to with both our internal and external stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe fervently believe that only Africans can develop Africa, and this gives us a stronger sense of relevance in all the countries where we have our operations. We are touching lives by providing their basic needs and empowering Africans more than ever before creating jobs reducing capital flight, helping the government conserve foreign exchange drain by supporting different industrial infrastructural projects of African government.\u201d\n\nMr. Chiejina stated further that Dangote Cement has been producing high quality and affordable cement, reducing poverty, engaging in unprecedented philanthropy, and above all respecting the laws of the land where we operate. \u201cAll these are our credo and we do not compromise it, it is our way.

Urban areas are centres of hope to the rich, the poor and even governments.\n\nA city\u2019s resilience level is never static; it changes from time to time, depending on what interventions and strategies there are, and how they are effectively implemented and monitored. It is also more about what happens in that city over a period of time, what it is fed on, how it sleeps, how its dwellers interact, how attached they are to it and how it is being governed. A city is best seen, managed and governed as a system; where each component and the relationship between components matter to the technocrats, the politicians and the general public.\n\nIt is wise for nations to have national resilience strategies, which ultimately should guide urban authorities. It is important for urban centres to do vulnerability mapping to enable the process of integrating their plans with the national resilience strategy.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has sent the globe into shock, and mobility has been obviously and severely affected as most guidelines prohibit movement while encouraging and forcing people to stay home. In terms of urban mobility, Uganda has taken some very drastic measures like closing Entebbe International Airport, banning public transport and eventually banning private cars, among other measures.\n\nOne can only imagine the courage President Museveni needed to ban public transport, limit the movement of boda bodas, and also ban the movement of private cars. Public transport, particularly 14-seaters taxis and boda bodas do not only \u2018move\u2019 Kampala, but they also feed it. They feed their operators (owners, drivers, conductors, stage managers, touts), plus move people to work, to school and to markets for food, among other daily activities. They, particularly, live from hand to mouth and depend on their daily earnings for survival.\n\nDue to their extreme informality, most of these are unable to have formal contracts with their employers, and that means their source of livelihood is extremely uncertain. Vulnerability in this is both social and economic, and could easily get political. It is a fault line, which has been exposed, and the pressure is being turned to government to provide for them, lest they die of hunger or if they survive, lose their civic pride-imagine queuing and fighting for food, and are being recorded, for the whole world to know/see; that you couldn\u2019t survive during the COVID-19 traumatic period. In some cases, social distancing cannot be a priority, but grabbing some little food is; understandably. It\u2019s time to formalize the informal; re-organize and modernize these systems.\n\nFor a car-centric city that Kampala is, several motorists were unable to move since the effecting of the private car ban. A good number of people have opted for bicycle transport and walking. But how ready was our city for alternative means of transport? Socially the attitude towards walking and cycling has been negative, and that means it may not have been an easy decision for city dwellers to opt for this mode of transport-moreover, without supportive infrastructure.\n\nJunctions and highways are particularly crucial for the safety of bicycle riders. What if this lockdown situation was to go on for a year? How would we avoid the spread of #COVID-19 while in transit? Are we ready to move our city by walking and cycling? If this turns out to be the case, those who live close to their workplaces and schools, for instance, might be lucky to pick up their lives and normal schedule.\n\nHowever, those who have longer commuter distances will find it difficult to cope with not only a new walking and cycling experience but also the long distances. I don\u2019t want to imagine our population riding and walking to and from work daily, for say, a total distance of 40 Km, on terrible and dangerous road infrastructure. This is yet another big fault line testing the resilience of our urban areas, especially, Greater Kampala.\n\nIt is no secret that our major land uses (housing, work, schools, social places, etc), lack a meaningful relationship and aren\u2019t self-sustaining. Some places are typically sleeping areas, while others have excesses in terms of service provision and densities.\n\nHowever, this is also a big opportunity for post-COVID-19. It may easily result in park and ride travel; whereby safe public car parking is available for motorists wishing to access the city centre to park their cars and take public transport or walk and ride bicycles.\n\nBesides reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, this would come with new opportunities like employment; managing the public car parking, public bike sharing, banking services, establishment of cafes and restaurants, and socially, as an opportunity for people to meet and interact.\n\nWe have also realized that as a city we have no mechanism of ensuring fresh food availability for the dwellers. Is it time to rethink urban agriculture, especially at the periphery of our urban areas? What about encouraging home gardening for fresh foods, particularly vegetables? What if all this was to go on for a year?\n\nObviously, there\u2019s a big difference between our rural areas and urban areas in terms of service provision and employment opportunities. This makes life in urban areas more attractive but unfortunately only in the short term, more so for those in the informal sector. What our government ought to know is that life isn\u2019t all about food and sleep. It\u2019s about employment, education, health and comfortable social life. We can\u2019t keep our rural Uganda in its current state of just food and sleep, while attracting the poor to urban areas, only to live from hand to mouth.\n\nThis, in such times, is not only life-threatening to the urban poor but also a burden to government. It is also a loss in terms of economic productivity. It is high time rural Uganda is given due and aggressive attention in terms of urban development priorities, creation of real employment, through industrialization, modernization of agriculture and promotion of tourism. This will not only enable balanced regional growth but will also limit the number of people getting attracted to urban areas for a vulnerable and deceptive better life.\n\nNevertheless, COVID-19 should serve as an eye-opener, that we always need various ways of doing things otherwise we shall never have the ability to absorb such shocks. What if this was to go on for a year?

Sometimes he\u2019d pull out a huge bandle of cash and just pull off a little, much less than I wanted and gave me. To me then, he was a stingy guy.\n\nAs a parent, I\u2019ve not bought every toy, shoe or such fancy thing as my kids ask, not necessarily because am unreasonable but because these are decisions I make with due consideration of all circumstances.\n\nThis is the situation facing employers and employees in the immediate aftermath of COVID19. Only pragmatism on part of both parties will keep their relationship lasting.\n\nLet\u2019s take the example of Sanyu employees. Sanyu, which is part of the Ruparelia Group has got a serious hit on its income, which is now down by almost 50% you could say but the owner is very wealthy, a billionaire who shouldn\u2019t reduce the salaries of employees.\n\nFine, but consider this. The man\u2019s hotels have been devastated by COVID19, so has his Flower business, his Restaurants, gyms, etc. as a landlord, he can\u2019t collect rent, because the tenants can\u2019t pay. If he evicts then he\u2019ll be deemed unreasonable.\n\nThe employment laws have dispute resolution mechanisms. But if in the middle of discussions the employees refuse to continue the discussions and even abandon work, do you expect the man to close the radio station as he finishes the discussions? What then happens to the advertisers? To the listeners?\n\nIt would be different if we are not faced with these situations or this disease. But here we are. We don\u2019t even know when it will subside.\n\nThe problem with Ugandans we never seek proper advice before from qualified persons. If they had consulted a good lawyer, they\u2019d have known two things. That industrial action is permissible but is subject to certain procedures, which in this case they didn\u2019t follow. That in-fact the employment act anticipates situations where an employer can not pay wages and salaries. With that in mind they will have approached this situation reasonably. You are now likely to hear stories of \u201cwe were misled\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a very rich man who owned a big hotel at Bakuli. Employees started disturbing him day in day out. He went on out of frustration and closed down the hotel. For the last almost 10 years. He left it there. People lost jobs but he has continued to live his life. He hasn\u2019t lost sleep.\n\nAny entrepreneur would totally understand. But most of the people complaining here don\u2019t employ even a house girl.\n\nThese are desperate times. Like Eneke the bird would say, since man had learned to shoot without missing, I have learned to fly without perching.\n\nI got on social media.\n\n========\n\nJulius Galisonga is a Kampala lawyer\n\nComments", "link": "https://www.pmldaily.com/oped/2020/06/julius-galisonga-why-employees-goofed-in-sanyu-fm-dispute.html", "published": "2020-06-12T04:30:23+00:00"}, {"title": "DAVID MAFABI: A case of COVID-19 pandemic in prisons offers chance to rethink our cells", "author": [], "text": "KAMPALA \u2013 The news that Uganda has already recorded the first Covid-19 case in prisons is an issue that requires urgent attention.\n\nThe prisons spokesperson, Frank Baine, while addressing the press on 10 May, said \u201cI am here to inform you that on Monday, the suspect was in isolation at our centre in Kaiti in Namutumba district, Eastern Uganda. But by close of business on Monday, results came, and we found him positive,\u201d\n\nHowever, while the one case tested positive for Covid-19 after testing may seem negligible, the way our prisons are crowded and the manner in which prisoners and inmates are transported in these marooned trucks, shows that prisons can easily spread the disease and inmates are very vulnerable.\n\nIt should be noted that Uganda\u2019s prison facilities have always been a ticking time bomb for communicable diseases, with cholera and typhoid secretly killing dozens of inmates every year and therefore prisons, police cells and remand homes provide ideal incubation conditions ripe for the rapid spread of Covid-19.\n\nThe government now faces the biggest task of preventing an explosion of the Covid-19 in prisons, police cells and remand homes across the country.\n\nA 2013 report by the International Centre for Prison Studies shows that Uganda is ninth among the top 10 countries with most overcrowded prisons in the world.\n\nThe report adds that the position makes Uganda prisons, which have over 38,000 inmates instead of the recommended 15,000, the most congested in the East African region.\n\nAlthough after the outbreak of Covid-19, the Uganda Prisons Service halted visits to prisoners from members of the public, this does not address crowding within the prisons.\n\nAs of September 2018, the occupancy rate within Uganda prisons stood at 315.4 percent, this means that to save inmates and limit the spread of Covid-19, government besides limiting open court hearing should also ensure prisons are not crowded and prisoners are not transported in crowded vehicles like animals being transported to the slaughterhouse.\n\nSeveral media outlets have written about this but the government\u2019s statements and actions, including the practice direction issued by the Judiciary, have omitted to address the issue that prisons and police cells are high-risk environments for transmission of diseases.\n\nRecords at prisons also show the staff-to-prisoner ratio is estimated at one staff to seven prisoners; as the Covid-19 situation escalates, there is a need for more restrictive measures to be imposed to ensure the prisoners/inmates are treated as human beings who have human rights.\n\nWe ought to ensure not only the security but also the health, safety and human dignity of people deprived of their liberty at all times, irrespective of any state of emergency.\n\nI, therefore, urge the government and the prisons authorities to bear in mind that the one Covid-19 positive case in prison is an isolated one but there are more cases in the waiting especially from the police cells across the country.\n\nIt is good that the government has developed and carried out a robust response by prioritising hand washing facilities and encouraging individuals to self-isolate as a key part of tackling the virus.\n\nBut it be noted that there is a particularly higher likelihood of the virus spreading rapidly when suspected criminals are in proximity to police and prison trucks being transported to the cells.\n\nAlthough most of the over 15,000 prison officers are housed in prisons together with their families and can move in and out, should any of the staff or their families pick up the virus elsewhere, it could easily be introduced into a prison, leading to an outburst.\n\nWhile social distancing and hygiene are being advanced by the government and scientists as the only sure ways of breaking the Covid-19 transmission chain, they seem to be non-existent in the country\u2019s 129 prisons.\n\nInterestingly, one will find our prison staff and police sitting on the same crowded vehicles putting their lives in danger of being infected by Covid-19 too.\n\nWith many people entering and leaving detention centres every year, the threat of COVID-19 for people in prisons is very real.\n\nIn the Uganda\u2019s overcrowded, dilapidated and underfunded prisons, police cells and detention centres, physical distancing is not a solution and in situations where close confinement, shared facilities and spaces and poor hygiene are commonplace, inmates and prison staff are living in constant fear of the ticking COVID-19 time bomb.\n\nI am not a prison nor a medical expert but I would like to suggest that: with Covid-19, congestion in prisons calls for implementation of alternative sentences, expansion of prison structures and construction of new ones.\n\nAnd the government should develop emergency multidisciplinary task forces that assess people for suitability for release. This means, having an access-to-health-care plan on the outside [and] having a home or at least a non-overcrowded institution, like a halfway house where they can practice social distancing and follow local shelter-in-place mandates.\n\nGovernment should also embark on reducing the prison populations because reducing the overall patient population means that medical professionals inside prisons and jails can more efficiently spread their clinical services and physical distance among the remaining population.\n\nWe could also restrict our prison staff, police staff and the remand home staff from travelling on the same vehicle with crowded prisoners without personal protection equipment like gloves and face masks, etc.\n\nLastly, government should create physical distancing plans for the people who remain; develop many communities where basically we have eight-to-10-person groups that almost function like a household, and there\u2019s correctional staff that are specifically assigned to that group and having this group allows officials to identify and isolate and then immediately quarantine a small group if there is a confirmed case, so they can keep the rest of the prison moving and not locked down.\n\nThe writer, David Mafabi is a Ugandan veteran journalist\n\nComments", "link": "https://www.pmldaily.com/oped/2020/06/david-mafabi-a-case-of-covid-19-pandemic-in-prisons-offers-chance-to-rethink-our-cells.html", "published": "2020-06-11T10:11:10+00:00"}, {"title": "You make us proud, now work harder using experience", "author": [], "text": "I congratulate the Department of Journalism and Communication upon reaching this important milestone of 30 years since it was started.

This year IWD comes at a point where various stakeholders including The Hunger Project Uganda (THP-U) and Community-Led Development (CLD) Uganda chapter has just provided input into the National Development Plan 111 as coordinated by the National Planning Authority. I must commend the framers of the 1995 Constitution of Uganda which has indeed guided the national agenda on women\u2019s human rights. Globally, commemorating 2020 IWD also marks a milestone moment for accelerating the implementation of global commitments to gender equality. It will be the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the adoption of its landmark outcome, the Beijing Declaration, and Platform for Action, a visionary agenda that set out how to remove the systemic barriers that hold women back from equal participation in all areas of life, whether in public or private.\n\nAs a country, we have made considerable progress in incorporating the principles and provisions of global and regional commitments on women\u2019s human rights in national legal and policy frameworks as well as setting up the institutional mechanisms to facilitate implementation across sectors. We are seeing increased enrollment of girls in primary schools, much more girls are completing tertiary education, more women have embraced farming, and there are growing businesswomen entrepreneurs in the country which is a positive trend.\n\nWhat do you have to say about the country\u2019s footing when it comes to gender equality in the efforts of social development?\n\nAlthough women constitute 51% of the total population; the gender development index value is 0.878, which reflects human development in favor of the male. More needs to be done in supporting women access better-paid jobs in the labor market to wave off the wage divide. Current statistics show the average income of male household heads is much higher than female household heads. Currently, THP-U is operating 8 SACCOs spread across 10 Districts, The chairpersons of all these SACCOs are women, The Managers of all these SACCOs are women and 60% of the membership are women, women in our epicenters can now borrow without collateral because of the solidarity group methodology used in these SACCOs, Women are able to save their income without incurring costs on their savings. Through entrepreneurial and financial literacy pieces of training, women now have enhanced abilities to start and run their business enterprises this has improved their incomes and changed their quality of life. And as you know, when women have an income, they can support their children access education, they will access healthcare, they will provide a nutritious meal to their family and those are very key determinants for social development.\n\nSince you started work, how do you gauge women\u2019s participation in addressing issues of food security and what more can be done?\n\nOne THP-U key thematic program is addressing Nutrition and Food security. For the last 20 years, THP-U has operated in Uganda, we have made significant investments in ensuring women are food secure and are the food basket for their families. THP-U operates a Gender Focused Community-Led Development (GFCLD) approach called the Epicenter Strategy. Communities led by women, draw their collective vision, make commitments and actions to end their own hunger and poverty. The Epicenters also operate food banks which are a key post-harvest handling mechanism geared to words improving the quality of products and also work as a storage facility to stock and sell when the prices are good. The Epicenters also have demonstration gardens were women pick the best agricultural practices and technologies and replicate them in their own gardens. Literally, THP has positioned women at the center of the food production system to address issues of nutrition and food security.\n\nHow far do you think Uganda has gone in helping women appreciate their reproductive rights and responsibilities?\n\nUganda continues to register progress in improving the health of women and the entire population; infant mortality rate has reduced from 81 in 2000 to 54 in 2015; maternal mortality rate has reduced from 505 in 2000 to 336 in 2019 though still very high; total fertility rate has drastically reduced from 6.9 in 2000 to 5.4 in 2019.\n\nSince 2016 with funding from the Dutch government THP-U has implemented Her Choice project that seeks to create child-marriage free communities in 7 Districts including Mbale. Through this project, we have learnt of the need for the Government to invest more resources in providing SRHR services especially to underserved communities like persons with disabilities. THP- U is also implementing another SRHR project, Safe Choices for deaf girls in Mbale with funding from DFID through Small Charities Challenge Fund (SCCF). Through this project, we have protected deaf girls from early pregnancy and early marriage by empowering them to make safe choices around their SRHR issues.\n\nWhat in your opinion is the best strategy for creating sustainable development for both men and women in Uganda?\n\nI think the future lies in investing and prioritizing community-led development initiatives. Actually in 2015, when the global community adopted SDGs as a new development agenda in New York where Uganda is also a signatory, a number of CSO actors including THP formed Community-Led Development (CLD) movement. The purpose was to create a space for women and men to play a catalytic role to transform the paradigm of development by mobilizing & empowering communities to take charge of their own development.\n\nIn simple terms, CLD is the process of working together with both women and men to create and achieve locally owned visions and goals.\n\nIt is a planning and development approach that\u2019s based on a set of core principles that sets collective vision and priorities by both men and women without any gender biases as people who live in that geographic community, it puts local voices in the lead, build on local strengths and works to achieve systemic change rather than short-term projects. That way, you can attain sustainable development for both men and women.\n\nIn Uganda, CLD chapter was launched in 2017 and currently, we have a membership of over 45 CSO partners. In February 2020 we sat together and come up with recommendations to the National Planning Authority that we hope will be included in the final National Development Plan111. We are asking the government to have a concrete strategy for community mobilization and mindset change that places both men and women as equal and active players in the development process of their households, their communities and their country Uganda without challenges of gender prejudices, cultural or traditional harmful practices that could be detrimental to both men and women\n\nAny last word?\n\nI congratulate people of Mbale for hosting this memorable event, all girls and women of this country who have worked very hard to create a difference in the lives of the girl child and women generally and also the men who have been our allies in this struggle. Let us use this event to reflect further on what more each of us can do to make our communities safe for everyone, to spread opportunities for growth and development to both men and women without any gender biases.\n\nContact :\n\nNakasero Kisozi Complex\n\nP.O.

died from the novel coronavirus, raising the death toll to 1,342, the Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Megahed said in a statement.\n\nThe highest coronavirus single-day fatalities in the country were seen on June 2 when 47 patients died from the disease.\n\nAs many as 503 coronavirus patients were completely cured and discharged from hospitals on Wednesday, increasing the total recoveries to 10,289, the statement said.\n\nMegahed highlighted Egypt\u2019s close cooperation with the World Health Organization regarding the virus, case detection and necessary medical care.\n\nThe capital

Egyptian government has been imposing a nighttime curfew as a key precautionary measure in combating the deadly virus.\n\nThe ongoing nine-hour curfew will continue until mid-June, when the government will consider easing relevant restrictions amid a coexistence plan to maintain anti-coronavirus precautionary measures while resuming economic activities.\n\nThe government has already started gradual reopening of services and offices, and allowed reopening of dozens of hotels for local tourists with 50-percent capacity after they were given official hygiene safety certificates.\n\n\u201cThe number of reopened hotels has reached 196 after 22 hotels in six provinces have been inspected and given an official safety certificate on Wednesday,\u201d Abdel-Fattah al-Aasy, assistant minister of tourism

optimise your internet data bundle as you continue to stay, work at home amid COVID-19 lockdown", "author": [], "text": "Data speed and bandwidth; what is the difference between these?\n\nThe Internet is like a pipe or a road over which information moves. It is actually a network of millions of public and private electronic networks all over the world that are interconnected, enabling information to be exchanged. Data is the form in which the information moves around the Internet.\n\nTo send and receive information from the Internet, one needs to have a connection, which is provided by an operator or service provider (also referred to as an Internet access provider).\n\nData speed is the rate at which the data is transferred across your connection. This is typically measured in bits per second (bps). Depending on the connection, this will be in kbps (Kilo bps), Mbps (Mega bps), or Gbps (Giga bps).\n\nThe bandwidth is the size of the \u2018pipe\u2019. It is the capacity of the Internet connection (the pipe) in terms of the maximum volume of data that can be transmitted in a given amount of time. The larger the size of the pipe, the more data that can be transferred per second.\n\nData throughput, on the other hand, is how much data gets transferred from one point on the network to another.\n\nCan I only connect to the Internet via a mobile network?\n\nThere are different types of Internet connections, offering different performance in terms of data speed and mobility. These include optical fibre, cable, ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line) that uses traditional fixed telephone line connections, satellite (VSAT \u2013 very small aperture terminal), WiFi, and 3G/4G mobile networks.\n\nThe different types of connection are associated with various pros and cons. However, the choice of connection is typically dependent on your requirements or needs, e.g.:\n\nThe location at which you desire to access/use the Internet services Whether you need a connection for a fixed location or you shall be mobile Whether you are obtaining a connection for home, work or individual use The speeds and reliability of service that you need.\n\nThe following are recommended in determining the type of connection:\n\nDetermine what speeds and reliability you need. You want an Internet connection that is fast enough and offers you the performance quality suited for services and applications you want to use the Internet for. You don\u2019t want to pay for a lot more than you will end up using. There are a number of tools available on the Internet that can help you in evaluating your speed needs, such as https://www.verizonwireless.com/freedom/datacalculator.html\n\nCheck which licensed operators are able to provide services in the area(s) in which you require Internet access. Coverage areas differ from operator to operator.\n\nSeek out and study information on the following from the operators that are able to provide services in the location(s) desired:\n\nPackages offered and associated pricing Data speeds Installation and equipment requirements and costs Terms and conditions of service (service level agreement)\n\nCompare the offers of the different operators offering service in your desired area. The accredited website http://kompare.ug/data/mobile-internet-rates/ can assist you in the case of wireless services.\n\nHow is Internet usage billed?\n\nInternet subscriptions are either paid for in advance of consumption (prepaid) or bound by contract for post consumption (postpaid) payment arrangements.\n\nA data bundle is like a token. Every time you use the Internet over that connection, you use a part of your data allowance or credit. The amount of data you use, though, does vary depending on the service or application you are using or accessing over the Internet.\n\nData usage is billed based on the volume of data sent and received via the Internet connection and not the time spent connected to the Internet. It is typically in packages measured in megabytes (MB) and gigabytes (GB).\n\nA data bundle may be associated with a specific validity/expiry date or can be unlimited in terms of expiry date. If the bundle reaches the validity date and expires before the bundle is depleted, it is foregone.\n\nWhat are the factors that may affect the speed at which your data bundle is used up?\n\nAnything you do on your phone or computer that accesses the Internet eats into your data bundle. So when you download or send emails, browse the Internet, send and receive messages over WhatsApp, check Facebook and Twitter, watch videos on YouTube, download movies from Netflix, you use the Internet and therefore eat into your data bundle.\n\nHowever, different apps use different amounts of data. Downloading applications (apps), playing online video games, streaming music, and watching videos use a lot of data when compared to the use of location, weather, and social media apps. Similarly, watching video online is one of the quickest ways to consume your data.\n\nThe size of the pipe (the bandwidth) also affects the data speed. A key characteristic that distinguishes the mobile technologies -2G, 3G and 4G is the capacity (bandwidth) and thus data speed. When using a smartphone to download a file using a 2G, it will take a longer time to download than downloading the same file on a 3G network connection and on 4G.\n\nHowever, this does not imply that 4G uses more data than 3G, but due to the faster data speed, your data is likely to be used up much faster. This is because the fast speeds will enable you to easily do more on the Internet, such as downloading one item after another, thus increasing your usage. Imagine, if you usually take an hour to download a movie and now you are able to do so in a matter of seconds. You are likely to instead download more than one video, or do so more frequently.\n\nVarious apps such as WhatsApp have also evolved over the years in terms of their capabilities and abilities, resulting in these having higher data needs than before. Viewing of videos and high-resolution images on applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram consumes more data than just plain text. Additionally, apps such as cloud services that provide mirroring or back-up services usually continue to run as long as there is an internet connection.\n\nFor feature phones, most apps and services only connect to the Internet on demand. On smartphones, however, apps can fetch any new information and update themselves. As a result, when an update of an app becomes available, the phone owner has a period of about a week to update the app. After this period, if the update wasn\u2019t done, the update of the app starts to download in the background. This can result in multiple apps running updates at the same time.\n\nIf the updates fail to be completed in the particular session due to low storage on the phone, depletion of the data bundle and other interruption, the update starts all over again. The app store also periodically checks to see if any of the apps installed on the phone has an update available. Additionally, apps such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Outlook mail periodically synchronise to check for any new activity or content updates on the user\u2019s account.\n\nNotably, when you add more devices or users onto your subscription (either via a modem or through tethering on your mobile phone), then your level of usage increases and the demand expands to include the background and auto-synchronisation apps such as Outlook mail on a computer. Note that some devices are more bandwidth-hungry than others, for example iPhones.\n\nOne factor that is likely to be a surprise to many is the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The encryption process in using a VPN adds about 10-15% more data usage. Using a VPN could, therefore, eat into your data bundle significantly, depending on what kind of content you are accessing using your VPN. The stronger the encryption, the higher the data overload. It is also common to have data speeds impacted with a resultant slower connection.\n\nAnother critical aspect to note is data roaming. Data roaming is when you use your subscription to connect the Internet outside of your home network coverage range, for example, when travelling abroad. At the time when you use your Internet subscription out of your home network, the phone is connected to and using network resources of another operator, which generally results in higher data charges due to compensation to the other operator for facilitating this connectivity.\n\nData consumption on an Internet connection can be likened to fuel consumption by a car, as illustrated in the table below.", "link": "https://www.pmldaily.com/business/tech/2020/05/how-to-optimise-your-internet-data-bundle-as-you-continue-to-stay-and-work-at-home-amid-covid-19-lockdown.html", "published": "2020-05-03T22:04:03+00:00"}, {"title": "COVID-19 CRISIS: StarTimes launches e-shopping platform \u2018StarTimes GO\u2019 to enable contactless shopping amid lockdown", "author": [], "text": "KAMPALA \u2013 StarTimes has launched an interactive e-shopping platform of premium selection named StarTimes GO to enable people to shop from home during the lockdown.\n\nThe newly born e-shopping service that will also cover Pan-African areas with Uganda and Kenya being the first countries as a pilot project, offers access to the no-touch \u201ctop\u201d shopping experience, namely through integrated services available via TV, Online and Phone-call.\n\nThis comes after businesses were asked to restrict the number of people in stores during the lockdown.\n\nStarTimes Uganda CEO, Mr. Franklin Wang the new development will save people the risky shopping hustles.\n\n\u201cWe know that a healthy environment is important for pandemic control thus we innovated a safe platform as well as a no-touch shopping method in order to help people stay safe in these difficult times,\u201d he said.\n\nThe programme of the same, started airing key channels including Sanyuka TV three times a day, Magic 1HD four times a day, and Face TV every after one hour.\n\nThe hosts of the programme will explain the feature, quality, usage of each product, and show the differences in one series, and the audience shall know the specific information without risking physical contact with a salesperson.\n\nWith the slogan \u201cBetter Life, Let\u2019s GO\u201d, the program frequently displays smart equipment such as TV sets, solar power systems, and decoders, and the category will be expanded gradually.\n\nAside from the safety consideration, a fact that makes your choice even wiser is that most products available are priced lower than the market price.

Even the United Nations (UN) declared that it considers internet to be a human right. Specifically, an addition was made to Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Therefore, everyone has the right to access internet.\n\nThe right to internet access is the view that all people must be able to access the internet in order to exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom of expression & opinion, and other fundamental human rights. It is therefore made available and affordable to all persons without discrimination. To access it, you need a plan which is offered by your internet service provider (ISP) such as; MTN, Airtel, Africell, Roko Telkom, Smart, Tangerine.\n\nInternet today costs as low as UGX250 and expensive as UGX550,000. While buying internet, one considers price & volume given the most, and other factors such as; speed, ISP. The volume of data is as well considered as a key factor. We published an article published showing mobile data comparison between MTN, Airtel, and Africell, and found out that Africell gives more data for less compared to its competition.\n\nHowever, cheap internet gets, not everyone can afford it. Not taking that more as issue, there are many ways of accessing the internet without speeding a penny. This can be through free Wi-Fi, office internet, ask a friend to buy you, among others. And what we are going to look at in this article, is \u2018Internet Sharing\u2019.\n\nIn this article, we show you how to share internet on MTN. MTN has an internet share plan just like Airtel\u2019s Tugabane. MTN Internet Share is a service that enables MTN customers to buy and share internet bundles with up to five other MTN customers. MTN has the Me2U option as one of the ways to share internet however, it is different in that here you share by sending some of your data to the recipient. For instance, if you have 2000MBs you can share 500MBs which isn\u2019t possible with Internet Share.\n\nGetting started with MTN Internet Share and How to Share\n\nBoth persons should be MTN users and their mobile numbers are valid.\n\nDial *150*70# >> select option one to choose between the three bundles they offer; 10GB at UGX50,000, 20GB at UGX20,000 and 30GB at UGX500,000. These offers are valid for 24 hours. Re-dial *150*7# and select option 2 to add up to 5 MTN users to share internet with. Use options 3 and 4 to see who you\u2019ve added and who to remove respectively.\n\nIt is possible to set usage limits for the different numbers activated to manage the bundle swiftly. In most cases, there will be that team member that doesn\u2019t need as much as the rest. Consequently, you can assign more volume to the members that certainly need it and fewer to those that use more Wi-Fi than Mobile Internet. Setting limits helps you prevent the users from exhausting your data quickly because they only use what has been assigned to them.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/06/mtn-uganda-internet-share-option/", "published": "2020-06-12T09:18:53+00:00"}, {"title": "Gov\u2019t Allocates 0.36% of the National Budget to the ICT Sector", "author": ["Almost Everything About Technology."], "text": "The government of Uganda through the Ministry of Finance on Thursday 11th, May 2020 passed the FY2020/21 National Budget reading, revealing the ICT and National Guidance sector gets 0.36% (UGX162.9 billion) of the UGX45.5 trillion. The budget was delivered to members of parliament by the Minister of Finance; Hon. Matia Kasaija and to the H.E. President Yoweri Museveni who followed and delivered his speech and remarks digitally from State House in Entebbe.\n\nThis financial year budget for the sector gets an increment from UGX146.2 billion (0.36% of UGX40 trillion) of the FY2019/20 budget. The money will be used perhaps by the sector to complete some of its tasks and pledges such as; continuous extension of the NBI Network to districts, departments and agencies, creating more fibre optic network links, among others. These pledges the sector looks at working on were revealed last month during the NRM manifesto week \u2014 a week where Ministries come out to showcase the sector\u2019s achievements over the last four years.\n\nSome of the pledges the sector looks at working on include but not limited to;\n\nDeveloping an ICT innovation framework, which will, among others, guide on innovation areas, funding opportunities and innovation partners, clients and innovation resources. Supporting existing hubs through training, affordable bandwidth, mentoring and innovation infrastructure. A mentoring and coaching centre for SMEs will be established for quality assurance. This measure will also be complimented with support to SMEs certification and standardization of local products. Targeting areas for innovation and linking them up with private sector innovators, with a view of developing viable solutions for commercialization. Establishing multi-purpose ICT parks which will attract both foreign and domestic entrepreneurs. Establishing ICT innovation Centres of Excellence. Creating and implementing appropriate incentive schemes for BPO operators and IT innovators. Furthermore, we will market Uganda\u2019s BPOs to the external market.\n\nThe President further gave directives to the sector clearly spelling out specific interventions in achieving the set out plans before end of 2021. Thereby, the money allocated to the sector will be much of use. His directives included;\n\nStoping the criminally irresponsible and biased reporting by media houses. Propagating the use of electronics in Uganda and supervise the mastering of this technology. Encouraging the assembling of computers in Uganda and do away with importing already assembled computers \u2500 old or new. Eventually, to build our own computers and mobile devices.

It\u2019s so accessible, which makes it extremely useful in more remote parts of the world, where there no banks.\n\nNow banks with the authority from telecoms, allow their customers access their bank accounts on their mobile phones, through the mobile money platform. While in a remote area where there are no banks, you can now easily access it via your mobile phone.\n\nOne is for instance able to withdraw money right from a bank account into the mobile money account as well as make a deposit (from mobile to bank).

Amongst them included innovators, aspiring musicians & music producers, farmers, motivation speakers, to mention a few \u2014 all with a dream their seek.\n\nMTN will soon announce the winner(s) and the prize give-away.\n\nThe \u2018What\u2019s Next\u2019 campaign was rolled out by MTN Group in November last year and is running across 21 countries in which MTN operates. In Uganda it\u2019s running under the theme; \u2018Whatever your dream, let\u2019s create it together\u2019 targeting mostly the youth.\n\n\u201cThe youth have many dreams. Since we are in the business of connectivity we want to be the link that connects the youth to their dreams. Our pledge to the public is whatever your dream, let\u2019s create it together,\u201d said Mr. Wim Vanelleputte; Chief Executive Officer at MTN Uganda.\n\nLike MTN, many of the leading businesses, companies and enterprises started from an idea that sprung from a dream. Youths have many dreams and MTN wants to help them bring their dreams through this campaign.\n\nHowever, the catch of the campaign on the side of the telco is to see how these dreamers embed some of the MTN services such as MTN MoMo; using mobile money as a payment gateway, MTN Internet, MTN SMS and Calls to achieve their dreams.\n\nFor instance, in the promo What\u2019s Next video, a young boy had an idea of bringing power to their community after seeing his little brother studying under a candle light. With a group of friends, with the use of MTN Internet, they made some research after which by using MTN MoMoPay to pay for the products they would use for their project. Communicating amongst themselves with MTN calls and sms.\n\nAfter seeing their idea succeeded, they later pitched it to a group of investors to see that their idea is turned into a business and helping connecting communities to power that they never had.\n\nTherefore, being the home to exciting, inspirational, innovative people in the telecommunication industry, MTN is passionately and selflessly working to make it\u2019s customer\u2019s lives a whole lot brighter each day.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/06/mtn-closes-whats-next-challenge-closes/", "published": "2020-06-02T09:32:20+00:00"}, {"title": "U.S. Ban on Huawei isn't About Cyber Security, But 5G Leadership Race", "author": [], "text": "The United States ban on Huawei is not greatly about cyber security and national security concerns as continuously stated. It\u2019s all about the state of 5G leadership in the world to cripple the Shenzhen based technology company; Huawei, from dominating the world\u2019s networks with its state of the art 5G architecture and equipment.\n\nIn May 2019, the United States Department of Commerce added Huawei on an entity list.\n\nEven with cyber security and national security as the top claims banning Huawei from the Central North American country, the U.S. further extended Huawei\u2019s ban to May 2021, after a full year of compliance and no-Involvement in the country\u2019s business and tech ecosystem.\n\nThis proves that cyber security is not the core claim, given the time frame of the ban, but rather a goal to limit Huawei from procuring necessary components to up its 5G division, and general technology equipment catalogue.\n\nAs a result of the ban, Huawei as a fast pace company has since 2019 devised ways to serve its customer base and continue to blend as a 5G industry leader. The company\u2019s roadmap includes, a custom operating system to power its smartphones; HarmonyOS, and procurement of technology components from other countries and suppliers like Samsung in South Korea.\n\nIn the light of the current covid-19 pandemic, the unilateral changes of trade rules by the U.S. will hurt the world\u2019s efforts in recovering the economy in the post covid-19 world.\n\nWith the new rule, exported semi-conductors and technology equipment would require a company to request for authorization before using the specified technology.\n\nBy way of example, the new rule is an equivalent of noting that a company is not allowed to make face masks during the coronavirus pandemic, because a pair of American scissors are used in the mask production line, unless initially approved to do so.\n\nBut given the highly interdependent semi-conductor industry with no room for a country or company to build a vast supply chain of its own. These changes would further detoriate the already hard-hit global economy that requires urgent need for an open, collaborative, and yet stable global value chain.\n\nIn opposition to the U.S. proposed changes in export controls that would give Huawei a clear signal to move-on to other suppliers, SEMI\u2014A Global Industry association serving the electronics manufacturing and design supply chain, through its President Ajit Manocha wrote to President Donald Trump on how the new rules would harm chip making exports that bring-in over USD$20 billion in revenue annually.\n\n\u201cThe move will serve as a disincentive for further investments and innovation in the U.S. and lead to the design-out of U.S. technology and components \u201d Manocha wrote.\n\nHe further noted that, the potential to create uncertainty for supply chains critical in the current covid-19 pandemic fight, require steady unity. With an upper merit, top exported-to companies like Huawei would devise new ways to procure if not manufacture chips in several countries including China, in a bid to stay blind from US suppliers of semi conductor design tools and production equipment.\n\nIn the shadow of cyber security claims by the U.S. that Huawei has continuously denied, the twist in export rules continues to justify the competition scale in 5G leadership in order to give U.S. companies, and its allies an advantage to participate in the 5G race.\n\nIn admission, the U.S. Attorney general William Barr remarked during the China initiative Conference by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), that Huawei as a leading 5G supplier on every continent except North America would need to be slowed down, in order for local companies to join the leadership race.\n\n5G Infrastructure business relies on radio access network (RAN) facilities, And now, China\u2019s Huawei and ZTE are the world\u2019s leading RAN suppliers taking a lion share of 40% with aggressive attempts to pursue the balance shared by Finland\u2019s Nokia with 17%, and Sweden\u2019s Erickson rocking a 14% share, among other suppliers.\n\nHence, with currently no American Company dealing in 5G equipment, a need to slow down Huawei as the industry leader would buy private companies more time to encroach on a Hyena\u2019s share as AG William Barr added.\n\n\u201cWithin the next five years, 5G global territory and application dominance will be determined. The question is whether, within this window, the United States and our allies can mount sufficient competition to Huawei to retain and capture enough market share to sustain the kind of long-term and robust competitive position necessary to avoid surrendering dominance to China. The time is very short, and we and our allies have to act quickly. \u201c Said William Barr\n\nHowever, the limitations pounded on Huawei branded with cyber security, not only affect its drive to 5G leadership, but also delay 5G roll-out in African countries and U.S. allies like the United Kingdom.\n\nCurrently, several countries have tested, but not fully implemented 5G due to the low rollout rate. In Africa, MTN tested 5G in South Africa, Uganda and Nigeria, as Kenya\u2019s Safaricom prepares to fully implement the network standard with Huawei as its supplier of choice.\n\nSo, as the U.S. continues to shatter Huawei\u2019s path to 5G dominance, its competitors are focused-on, as the potential drivers to share a path ruled by the 5G giant. As a matter of fact, the U.S. ban has continuously forced Huawei to seek a new path with non-US suppliers due to tightened license requirements.\n\nWith alternative paths off the U.S. road map shining to Huawei, Continuous bans, and subsequent cyber security claims could soon have zero effect to the company\u2019s future. Identically, Huawei\u2019s continued evolution for custom systems in its enterprise, cloud and customer delivery divisions continue to give it an advantage in the 5G sphere amidst any future claims tagged to the company.\n\nSo, discriminating a company with claims by its country of origin is wrong for the future of 5G. Let alone, the value Huawei creates for its customers and clients evidenced by its market value and performance is outstanding.\n\nHenceforth, the United States could be in a tough trade-war with China, but the involvement of creatively fast evolving companies like Huawei (Important to its supply chain) in subsequent bans, and false claims to scare its allies, simply confirm that the US is shooting itself in the foot, but not realizing it at the moment.\n\nOpinion article by Humphrey Mpairwe; Technology Enthusiast", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/06/u-s-huawei-ban-is-about-5g-leadership-race/", "published": "2020-06-02T10:37:31+00:00"}, {"title": "MTN Clarifies on Ruling to Pay UGX 24 Billion in Taxes to URA", "author": ["Posts On This Account Are Made Various Editors."], "text": "In August 2016, URA issued MTN with an assessment of UGX326,996,917,906 for unpaid taxes arising between the period 2011 \u2013 2014.

Out of 1,053 respondents that visited the survey page, 800 completed the survey, yielding a completion rate of 75.97%.\n\nThe report had exciting finding, such as; the Ugandan developers ecosystem is comprised of Juniors. The highest percentage earns up-to UGX2.5 million and work in and around Kampala, with a few scattered in the other major cities including; Wakiso, Mbarara, Mukono, Mbale, and Gulu.\n\nWith developers work comes in research, thus the need to use the internet in their day to day work with varying levels of access/quantity.\n\nA great percentage of developers have honed their skills over the internet. When they get an error they usually copy the error and paste it in their web browser. When they want to learn something new, usually the first place they look for learning resources is the internet.\n\nThey also use the internet to access platforms that are considered work tools like GitHub, CI/CD platforms, PaaS, among others.\n\nSo, it then comes to what internet service provider (ISP) to use. Mainly while choosing an ISP, a lot of factors are considered such as; the cost, data volume, internet coverage, stability, among others.\n\nAccording to Andela\u2019s findings, developers are using Airtel internet more followed by MTN, Africell, Roke, Smile, Zuku, Tangerine, and UTL. Airtel internet came out with a percentage of 36.3% with its biggest competition MTN at 35.6%.\n\nMTN and Airtel are the preferred ISPs because they have wider internet coverage in and around the city. Their connections are also considered the more reliable ones in the market.\n\nDevelopers spend up to UGX150,000 on internet every month, according to the report. However, because not all can afford to spend that, the highest percentage (32.6%) was UGX20,000 to UGX50,000 every month.\n\nAndela simply breaking it down on how these developers spend on internet. Junior developers spend the least, an average UGX50,000 while Mid-level developers spend an average of UGX75,000 and senior developers spend the most, an average of UGX100,000.\n\nAndela noted that junior developers need way more internet than they are paying for and yet they are not able to afford it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC) released a report showing findings that Airtel Uganda has the fastest internet speeds in the country.\n\nFrom the findings, Airtel had the best download throughput in 17 districts with its maximum being 14Mpbs in Mityana and Soroti where MTN scored 2.5Mbps and 4Mbps respectively while Africell scored 3.8Mbs and 3.9Mbs respectively.\n\nAirtel has previously had ups and downs about its 4G network. In July of 2019, UCC summoned them to respond to allegations that its 4G data speeds are not what\u2019s advertised following customer complaints claiming the speeds aren\u2019t stable even in areas they expect to be.\n\nThe commission carried out investigation in some areas where Airtel 4G is deployed including; Kampala, Mukono, Entebbe, and Jinja finding out that even though the 4G were available, the speeds were much lower than what is internationally expected from a 4G connection.\n\nVG Somasekhar; Airtel Uganda Managing Director, came out defending the telco stating they have the best 4G data speeds in Uganda.

What used to be simply strolling across the office for advice and updates now necessitates a complex email chain that you\u2019re hoping all of your staff will be online to read, digest, and reply to. In this article, then, we recognize this difficult time and offer some tips to help your business manage the requirements for remote collaboration.\n\nThe three tools listed below will help your business adapt to the new working conditions brought about by COVID-19.\n\nFor Staff\n\nYour biggest preoccupation, as a business manager, is keeping your staff busy with tasks that\u2019ll get the most out of them during lockdown. Without direction, guidance, and discipline, your staff may quickly lose their motivation and their drive to contribute positively to your company during this challenging time.\n\nAs such, you should be on the lookout for the best remote collaboration tools that\u2019ll help your staff communicate and work together, despite the distance that separates them. These may include Microsoft and Google\u2019s amazing repertoire of tools, or small companies and their incredible contributions to the remote working software ecosystem. Research a little and read articles from other business leaders to discover what\u2019ll be the best choice for your staff.\n\nFor Managers\n\nMeanwhile, you should also be on the lookout for the programs, software solutions, and digital tools that\u2019ll help you run your business as a manager or a startup founder. In this case, you\u2019re not looking for collaboration software \u2013 you\u2019re looking for ways in which you, as a manager, can stay abreast of your staff\u2019s movements and projects. You need to be in several different loops, and managing this via email can quickly leave you swamped and stressed.\n\nAs such, companies have started to produce and release incredibly useful analytics software that helps managers understand the communication and collaboration work that their staff is doing remotely. These platforms can help managers get that much-needed overview of what\u2019s happening in their enterprise at any given time. For instance, Microsoft Teams Analytics can help you keep an eye on all the work that\u2019s taking place on your team\u2019s Microsoft software.\n\nFor Customers\n\nFinally, your customers also need to know that your business is trustworthy during this period of lockdown and remote working. They need to be able to understand that their money is safe with you, and that you\u2019ll still be able to offer the high quality of service that they expect from you. As well as using smart communications to inform your customers about changes to your business, you should also employ tools to set their minds at ease.\n\nFor instance, if you can use automation software to send out emails and updates to all of your registered customers at once, you\u2019ll save your staff time in drafting communications, and you\u2019ll be able to respond quickly to the queries that customers are sending to your business.\n\nCovering your staff, your managers, and your customers, these toolkit tips are designed to help you adapt to remote working collaboration in 2020 and beyond.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/05/collaboration-tools-for-businesses/", "published": "2020-05-28T10:27:15+00:00"}, {"title": "Where Are the Best Search Engine Optimization Services?", "author": [], "text": "If you want to hire a programmer, you turn to Slovakia or Poland.

Though there are always obstacles to working with a service provider halfway around the world \u2014 like language barriers as well as differences in time zone that result in work delays \u2014 in general, the work itself is going to be the same if not much better for a much lower price than you can find within the U.S.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t true for SEO. While SEO professionals around the world undoubtedly have a similar understanding of search algorithms and skill in manipulating them, you can\u2019t always trust that an SEO far from home will be able to help your search rankings budge on the home front. Search engines vary from place to place; not only are different search providers more popular in different areas of the world but major engines, like Google, simply perform different types of searches depending on the location of the web user. Not only will rankings of your webpages vary from place to place, but the rankings of your SEO competition will, as well. As a result, an SEO provider in China might never be able to access the same search results page as you and your audience sees, which means they can\u2019t always offer the most useful advice for improving your ranking.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, some SEOs around the world continue to rely on exceedingly outdated techniques. Tactics like link spamming and keyword stuffing might suffice in parts of the world that are new to the internet, but they will only earn you ranking penalties in the U.S. Search engines work hard to discourage SEO practices that worsen user experience, so when they detect nefarious SEO tactics, search engines will send related pages much lower in the rankings or de-index related URLs entirely.\n\nSo, if you shouldn\u2019t trust low-budget SEO services from countries outside the U.S., where should you go for quality SEO?\n\nIn the U.S.\n\nIf you operate a business within the United States, it is within the United States that you should look for SEO services. There are a few basic reasons why hiring a U.S.-based SEO business is important, such as the guarantee that you will speak the same language and assured overlaps in your hours of operation. However, more importantly, American SEOs will be more familiar with American search engines, American search habits and American business goals than SEOs from across the world. Because SEO is so closely tied to your greater digital marketing strategy \u2014 drawing upon content, social media, web design and more \u2014 it is essential that you take advantage of SEOs who understand what you want and need from your SEO services.\n\nIn Your Region\n\nYet, it is even more critical that you hire an SEO firm within your region of operation. Again, this solves obstacles related to time zones \u2014 but that isn\u2019t the only reason to hire an SEO close to home. The United States is large and boasts dozens of dialects, cultures and consumer attitudes; an SEO operating within your region has a better understanding of your audience\u2019s habits and behaviors, especially as they pertain to online search. Plus, your regional SEOs will see exactly the SEO results pages that you and your audience sees, including localized results, so they can do even more to improve your ranking.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that you should feel compelled to hire whatever po-dunk SEO firm you find next door. Rather, if your business is local to some city in the Southwest, like El Paso or Pueblo, you might hire a Phoenix SEO agency with an exceptional reputation and longstanding experience in the field. Then again, if your business is national or international, you might consider hiring a handful of SEO firms in different regions to address different regional needs.\n\nOutsourcing SEO is smart, but you don\u2019t need to bother searching other countries for reliable SEO services. Instead, you should vet a few different firms in your area to find the best possible SEO for you.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/05/where-are-the-best-seo-services/", "published": "2020-05-27T11:04:52+00:00"}, {"title": "How to Use Tech to Improve Employee Performance", "author": [], "text": "In today\u2019s technologically advanced times, there are many ways that businesses can use technology to help in all areas of the operation. One of the best areas to use technology is to improve staff performance as this can drive the company forward while also helping to improve morale, productivity, and various other essential areas.\n\nThere are several ways in which you can achieve this in 2020 using some of the latest and best technology, so read on for a few ideas for how you can use tech to improve the daily performance of your staff and, in turn, your entire business.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nMany businesses have adopted cloud computing in recent years, and this is for a good reason. This enables staff to easily access, edit, and share data anywhere with an internet connection, which means that people can collaborate and work remotely (a significant business trend worth adopting).\n\nAutomation\n\nAutomation is a word that can cause some anxiety amongst the workforce as people fear that it could lead to job losses. While this does happen in the business world, automation and employees can coexist and work well together. You could use automation to handle the repetitive tasks (which are often time-consuming and can lead to mistakes), which will free up time for staff to focus on critical aspects of their role so that they can excel in these areas while reducing their workload.\n\nChange Management Surveys\n\nYou will find that any changes in the daily operation can negatively impact employees, which is why it is essential to use change management surveys from places like inpulse.com. This will allow you to monitor emotions across different departments and identify any issues before they become major problems, allowing you to keep staff happy and engaged at all times so that they can embrace change and perform to a high standard each day.\n\nWearables\n\nWearable technology can help to improve employee performance in several ways. Items like smartwatches can give an employee immediate access to critical data without the need to be at their desk, which allows them to easily work. At the same time, on the move, plus these wearable gadgets can relay important information back to management so that you can identify ways on which you can help the employee to work to the best of their abilities.\n\nTraining with Augmented & Virtual Reality\n\nAR and VR are technologies that can serve many purposes in several different industries and will play a vital role in the years to come. One of the best ways to use these technologies is with training, as they can provide the closest possible real-life experience without any consequences so that people can learn and train with confidence.\n\nThese are just a few ways that technology can be used in the workplace to improve employee performance. It is amazing how tech is being used in today\u2019s day and age and when it is used to improve performance, it can help to take the entire company forward and allows you to get the most out of your team.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/05/tech-improving-employee-performance/", "published": "2020-05-21T17:09:40+00:00"}, {"title": "Traditional or Cloud Antivirus Solutions \u2013 Which is Best?", "author": [], "text": "Antivirus programs are vital to protect your PC, laptop, and your other devices from any harmful spyware, malware, ransomware, and adware. Both domestic users and companies alike are beginning to understand the importance of cybersecurity and taking steps to address potential threats.\n\nYet, when it comes to choosing antivirus software, it can be difficult to decide between traditional options or the latest cloud-based solutions. So \u2013 cloud antivirus vs traditional antivirus programs \u2013 how do you determine which is the best choice?\n\nTraditional Antivirus Solutions \u2013 The Issues\n\nAntivirus programs scan files and check them against a virus database. If it finds a program or file matching a definition in its database, it removes it from the device. However, as there are millions of virus definitions out there against which files must be compared, it\u2019s easy to see why this can pose problems to developers of traditional AV software.\n\nWhile developers want antivirus software to be as easy as possible on computers, the amount of activity during a scan means that all-too-often, they become so slow that, during a scan, they may even be unusable. Yet, antivirus software must have as many up-to-date virus definitions as possible to provide optimal service. Without this, countless new viruses popping up each day can enter and attack the computer system, making the software useless.\n\nCloud Antivirus Solutions \u2013 Solving The Problems?\n\nCloud antivirus programs have been designed to solve this exact problem. Cloud solutions keep all of the virus definitions on the provider\u2019s server. Since the millions of comparisons aren\u2019t being made on the computer itself, there is less impact on the device\u2019s performance during scans. This means it\u2019s possible to carry on working with no unwanted interruptions.\n\nEven better, cloud antivirus software always remains up-to-date as the provider takes care of all of the definition updates on the user\u2019s behalf. This means there is no need for the user to check for updates.\n\nAre There Any Downsides To Cloud AV Solutions?\n\nOne of the biggest issues with a cloud-based antivirus solution is that to obtain complete real-time protection the user has to have a working internet connection. If the device isn\u2019t online, any running programs or open files aren\u2019t being checked against the most up-to-date antivirus definition database.\n\nOne further issue is that, since everything is carried out via the internet, whole files usually aren\u2019t being sent by the device to the antivirus software to be scanned. Rather, only some of the file information is sent to the software to be evaluated. If something suspicious shows up that is inconclusive, the entire file may then be flagged up and sent for full scanning.\n\nAre There Any Solutions For Cloud AV Issues?\n\nAlthough a device isn\u2019t entirely protected by a cloud AV application while not online, it is still safer offline as risks are limited. Also, since the majority of cloud antivirus programs will keep some data on the device, the programs run regularly will usually be safe.\n\nCloud-based software also uses several methods to protect your systems and computer such as behavior monitoring. This method checks how files act to ensure they\u2019re safe. When those behaviors are spotted, the software will block the program or file and notify the user, allowing the malware to be removed safely. Behavior monitoring will check for files that modify \u201chosts\u201d files, send large numbers of emails in short time frames, change \u201cauto-run\u201d registry keys or generate executable programs.\n\nWhy Opt For A Cloud-Based Antivirus Solution?\n\nSince the antivirus provider\u2019s server has many users connected to it at the same time, instant protection can be obtained from new viruses affecting the devices of the other users. This is possible as, when a malicious program or file is spotted anywhere, updated definitions enter the primary system, giving immediate protection from the new threat.\n\nThese days, cloud solutions have begun to be incorporated into the more traditional antivirus software solutions, so it\u2019s likely that soon, all AV software will be found in the cloud. Even better, cloud-based software is more affordable and can help to save time since there\u2019s no need to regularly carry out device scans or update and maintain traditional AV software. With these advantages in mind, it\u2019s easy to see why cloud-based antivirus programs are overtaking the more traditional options.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/05/traditional-cloud-antivirus/", "published": "2020-05-19T07:00:47+00:00"}, {"title": "Impact of Digital Technology on Coronavirus and the Importance of Masks", "author": [], "text": "At this time of urgency of wearing a face mask, everyone is trying to look for it from different sources. It is available both in the wholesale online store and the retail shops.\n\nThe face masks are important that can prevent the spread of pandemic COVID-19. It is highly recommended to wear masks in public preventing the spread of the disease. But during this period of emergency, there is a dearth of masks online and offline. So, people are looking for some authentic sources that can offer masks.\n\nIn this relation, the medical mask wholesale sources are offering the masks. However, non-medical masks are not a suitable option to prevent the virus spread from person to person. Many of us are in confusion about whether the face masks can prevent the spread. Medical experts are suggesting that it is important for common people to use the medical masks.\n\nSurgical face masks\n\nThe surgical masks have lose fitting and it has been approved for various medical purposes. Even doctors, nurses, and medical attendants are recommended to use these masks when treating patients. It helps to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets that may contain the virus and infect other person. It is usually spread through mouth and nose when one person comes in contact with another. If you are suffering from coughs and sneezing, these masks are suitable to use.\n\nBut you need to ensure that you pick it from reliable sources to get quality ones. Not all masks available in the drug store are capable of preventing the virus spread. So, it is better to use masks with fine mesh that can catch even the smallest organism.\n\nWhat is the impact of digital technology on COVID-19?\n\nThe massive outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19 demands top-notch solutions of digital health technology like increased population screening, better resource allocation, and using technology to track the infection rapidly. However, for the appropriate design and quick execution of the initiatives and help the medical workers, the WHO seeks assistance from technology companies.\n\nBy utilizing the extensive spread use of technological advancement, it would be easy for doctors, medical attendants, and health agencies to offer better help to people in preventing the spread of the pandemic.\n\nBy technological influence, it would be easy to explore the known gaps in areas that lack the focus for curbing the outbreak. It includes better use of the application by health workers, easy recovery planning, smooth supply chain, contesting misconceptions, support the people with better knowledge and updated information. However, coordinate efforts from different technology companies shall help people in different countries fight different stages of the pandemic.\n\nWhy are respirators essential?\n\nThe other name for respirators is N95 respirator masks that prevent the spread of particles present in air like viruses. The mask has been named so as they are able to filter almost 95% of the virus. Other than this, the masks are also useful when engaged in painting or handling some harmful toxic items.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/05/digital-technology-on-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-05-15T12:08:01+00:00"}, {"title": "Exclusive Interview With James Byaruhanga On Raxio Data Centre", "author": ["Almost Everything About Technology."], "text": "Today, it is believed that Ugandan enterprises generating their own data and it then all comes to where it is stored/hosted. And since we don\u2019t have that much of data centres (DC) in the country, western DC are preferable the choice.\n\nAs of last year, the government through the National Information Technology Authourity \u2013 Uganda (NITA-U) opened a DC in Jinja but mostly serves government ministries. Thereby, leaving enterprises to opt for western DCs. Some or a few private businesses often store data on in-house servers or rent space in a center run by a telecommunications companies, like MTN or Airtel.\n\nNow, private firms like Raxio are coming into place to offer Ugandans, Ugandan business a place to have their data hosted locally. The DC is being built at the Namanve Industrial Park same as to where the state-owned DC is.\n\nPresident Yoweri Museveni cutting the ribbon officially launching the National Tier 3 Data Center in Jinja on Thursday June, 12th 2019.\n\nWith the road to launch Raxio in Uganda later this year, we sent a few interview questions to Mr. James Byaruhanga, General Manager at Raxio Data Centre to enlighten us briefly about the DC. It comes to our attention that the DC won\u2019t host data but rather provide a \u201cColocation Environment\u201d for their [Raxio] clients to host their equipment which may or may not host their data.\n\nThe session;\n\nBriefly tell us about Raxio Data Centre.\n\nRaxio Data Centre is an enterprise grade data centre coming soon to Namanve, Uganda. Raxio is building and will subsequently operate Uganda\u2019s first privately owned Tier III Level Neutral Data Centre Environment in Uganda.\n\nHow long till you launch a fully functioning data centre?\n\nIn line with delays as a result of covid-19 outbreak, we project the opening of this data centre to Q3 2020 (Est for September 2020).\n\nWhat is your opinion about the existing data centres, state-owned of course?\n\nWell we have some ISP and Telco owned relatively small facilities in the country which have so far been serving the market and we also some government owned facilities. We at Raxio are focusing on a purpose-built state of the art, Tier III Certified Neutral environment which is currently not available in the country. We also are looking to build a high availability and high capacity environment compared to what is available in the market .\n\nHow are you going to work with the government considering that Raxio is privately owned?\n\nThe Government Departments and Ministries are currently working with the National Information Technology Authority \u2013 Uganda (NITA-U) for their needs and we are keen to explore a conversation with NITA-U on whether we can provide them a redundant offsite location for their clients, however this is early days for the conversation since NITA-U has its own strategy for Government needs. We are open to any client that needs our services however our primary focus is Private Sector driven.\n\nWhat kind of data do you plan on hosting and why?\n\nWe do not plan to host data but rather to provide a Colocation Environment for our clients to host their equipment which may or may not host their data. Our business model is not data hosting but rather Colocation for our client\u2019s equipment for the purpose of data hosting or cross connection to their clients or providers. These clients can range from private enterprises, Internet Service providers, Fibre Carriers, Cloud Providers, Content Delivery Networks to mention but a few.\n\nWill the same plant host backups or you plan on having a separate backup centre?\n\nThis plant may be a primary site for some clients or it will be a back up site for the client. The choice belongs to the client. However, if you are asking whether we plan to build another site in Uganda as a back up to this site, then YES. We have a short term plan to build a secondary site.\n\nJames Byaruhanga with other project members at the Raxio Data Centre construction site in Namanve.\n\nLooking at job opportunities, how many people does Raxio plan to employ and what percentage of Ugandans are we looking at?\n\nData centres create employment opportunities in phases and waves. During construction we have created employment through contractors & consultants to the tune of about 500 employees. However when it goes live for business it is a low staff count business due to the level of automation that facility runs on. We will have atmost 30 permanent staff, however support and maintenance of the equipment will be outsourced which in turn may create employment opportunity of another 30 to 50 people, indirectly.\n\nDo you have a charging plan; will it be or is it in UGX?\n\nWe have a rate card and its currently in USD. We are exploring the UGX option and how to roll it out.\n\nHow can the mindsets of Ugandans be changed from use of western centers to local centres?\n\nBy delivering a western level quality service, faster, more reliably and probably cheaper to the consumer. The other way is by attracting the western providers to extend their infrastructure to Uganda so that the consumer can get the same service delivered to them a lot better from Uganda.\n\nRaxio Data Centre, we understand it\u2019s Tier III Level Neutral Data Centre, in a layman\u2019s language, how do you explain this?\n\nWe want to build a facility that is fully redundant. Every system we deploy should have a back up device in case of failures or maintenance, the site should always be up. We aim to deploy equipment in a concurrently maintainable configuration, for example 2 Generators Systems, 2 Air conditioning systems, 2 fire suppression systems etc, this is the only way we can provide 99.9% service availability for our clients.\n\nYou chose Namanve Industrial Park and one of the reasons is ensuring resilient & high bandwidth connectivity solutions, elaborate on this.\n\nNamanve industrial part has about 10 Independent Metropolitan Fibre cables in it for last mile access, this is critical for client and at the same time, Namanve is on the highway to Kenya where Uganda picks up Sub Marine Fibre capacity and therefore about 8 fibre connections to Mombasa for internet transit. The location is perfect.\n\nPresident Museveni being toured inside the National Tier 3 Data Center in Jinja by NITA Uganda\u2019s Peter Kahiigi.\n\nHow will Raxio lay the ground for the next level of digital infrastructure?\n\nBy attraction of international carriers, content delivery networks and cloud providers to colocate in Raxio. These will in turn cross connect through the Internet Exchange Point at Raxio with the local telecoms and ISPs, to extent these next level services and trends for example 4th Industrial revolution services to Uganda for example IoT and Big Data.\n\nLastly, has covid-19 in one way or the other affected Raxio development(s)?\n\nIt has slowed down our construction due to delayed shipments, social distancing which affects the construction works and finally the travel restrictions have affected movement of the specialists that we need in country to install the specialized equipment we need to get this machine running.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/04/interview-with-james-byaruhanga-on-raxio-data-centre/", "published": "2020-04-24T10:20:00+00:00"}, {"title": "Robert Kwesiga Highlights How COVID-19 Funds Collected Be Used", "author": ["Posts On This Account Are Made Various Editors."], "text": "The Secretary General, Uganda Red Cross Society of Uganda, Mr. Robert Kwesiga in a brief interview, shared more details on how the collected funds through its newly introduced MTN MoMoPay merchant account be used.\n\nTo recall, telecommunication firm; MTN Uganda launched 191919; a MoMoPay Merchant Account where MTN customers are in position to donate/send money to Uganda Red Cross towards efforts to combat the spread and fight of coronavirus as well as support those most affected by the pandemic.\n\nMr. Kwesiga appreciated MTN\u2019s gesture and reiterated the society\u2019s commitment to alleviate the human suffering that is increasingly being experienced by communities especially the most vulnerable people in society.\n\nHere briefly highlighted how the funds will be used, its beneficiaries, accountability, among others;\n\nWhat will the money be used for?\n\nThe money will be used to procure and provide essential food assistance to the most vulnerable households whose livelihoods, from their informal jobs, have been adversely affected by the partial lockdown instituted in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Uganda. This will complement the initiative that the Government of Uganda has started.\n\nWho are the beneficiaries?\n\nThe beneficiaries are poor households who live in informal settlements in urban areas and are adversely affected by the partial lockdown instituted by Government, because they can no longer afford food for their households owing to disruptions of their informal employment.\n\nWhere will the activities related to this project be executed?\n\nThe food distribution shall continue on a rolling basis all through the period during which people are restricted to their homes due to the partial lock down period. At a later date, an early recovery livelihood intervention programme shall be instituted after the covid-19 pandemic is controlled so as to support the affected vulnerable households bounce back to normal, dignified lives.\n\nFor how long will funds be collected?\n\nFunds to support these interventions shall be required throughout the period of the lock down, and after the pandemic is controlled so as to sustain all recovery efforts for the affected households.\n\nWhen/How often will proceeds be announced/declared?\n\nTotal amounts collected shall be announced by the Red Cross on a weekly basis and later after further gaps are identified, the public shall be informed of any extra support required.\n\nHow will accountability for the funds collected be communicated and in what intervals?\n\nAll funds and other donations received towards this cause shall be put to good use as planned and accounted for in accordance with Uganda Red Cross standard financial guidelines. These funds shall be subjected to formal audit, whose report shall be published on the URCE website and in other official communication channels that shall be open for public viewing.\n\nDoes the public have a say in how the collections are spent?\n\nThe Uganda Red Cross shall remain accountable and engaging to the public, as much as possible.

Vaolah expands on this.\n\nWhat is the inspiration of Wena Hardware?\n\nWena Hardware is an inspiration of stories of Ugandans in diaspora with plans of construction here at home. They work tirelessly, send money back home to friends or family to procure building materials on their behalf, only for these funds to be used by the recipients for their personal gain.\n\nSo with Wena, Ugandans in diaspora are able to purchase products remotely, pay directly through bank accounts without the need of sending money to someone who might use the money for personal gain.\n\nSo in brief, Wena Hardware is a solution solving what problem?\n\nIn brief, wenahardware.com solves the lack of a remote option to buy building materials and get them delivered on ones site (place of construction).\n\nWho is your competition and what differentiates you from them?\n\nPhysical hardware stores may be considered as competition but we however work closely together. And as Wena, besides enabling users buy building supplies from home market, we also enable them buy supplies across the globe through our feature Wena Global and get them delivered to Uganda.\n\nSo Wena is still in its early stage, what are the hardest things you encounter?\n\nYes Wena is still in its early stage. Resources at an early stage of a business are never enough. Sometimes I wish I had 72 hours in a day to complete my daily tasks. And because of this, extra manpower would be ideal to get more work done, yet one is operating on quite a lean budget. Just like I mentioned, it takes extra determination and calls one to be organized.\n\nDo you think that luck plays a role in the success of a start-up?\n\nLuck plays a role only when you are consistent, determined and organised. Without these, luck may not have any role to play towards success.\n\nHow are you leveraging technology as a strategic direction to your start-up?\n\nAs an online hardware store, we use digital channels to engage with clients and process orders. Our entire business transactions happen online.\n\nWhat are some of the new ideas you plan on implementing on Wena?\n\nWena Global is our latest feature on wenahardware.com, it has however been operational for months now.\n\nInnovators at times claim after winning competitions they don\u2019t receive the promised prizes. So in September last year we learnt that Wena was recognized as an outstanding innovation at Afrolynk, did you claim your prizes?\n\nYes. I did a 3 months capacity building with Green Tech Capital Foundation, and I will travel to Viva Tech in Paris, France for me and the business.\n\nChallenges at Wena Hardware and the strategies put in place to overcome them?\n\nWe just have to be swift in implementing customer feedback.

Their innovation drove to the rise of competitors such as; UberBoda, Taxify Boda, Dial Jack, Taxido, among others.\n\nInaugurated in 2014, the moto-taxi hailing company now has over 8000+ registered riders operating within areas of Kampala, and Entebbe with plans of expanding beyond. And with the 8000+ riders and counting, they are all pioneered by Moses Musinguzi\u2014who happens to be the company\u2019s first rider. This will remain in history of the company\u2019s book, considering the fact that he holds helmet number 1.\n\nWhile we (me inclusive) thought that the helmet number 1 was held by one of the company\u2019s Co-Founders, well we were wrong. Moses Musinguzi is the true holder of this mighty number.\n\nMoses came to popularity after the company started a campaign dubbed I Found the 1\u2014and who ever found him was rewarded with either safeboda credits, MTN data bundles, lunch coupons, movie tickets, among others. On the other hand, the company was pushing, and recommending its customers to go cashless\u2014paying for their trips using safeboda credits, that can be purchased via mobile money.\n\nWhile we went through hustle to set up this interview, from his busy schduled PC Tech Magazine managed to secure one. We sat down with Moses at their head offices in Bukoto St, Kampala, and this is what we had with him;\n\nHow did you become a Safeboda rider and what inspired you to stick with the company to date?\n\nI became a Safeboda when the team reached out to me at my Stage (Endiro \u2013 Kisementi) in early 2014. They told me about the idea and was immediately sold; I saw an opportunity to be respected as a professional boda boda rider therefore I chose to join Safeboda.\n\nWhy am sticking to the company? Well, there are so many reasons; Safeboda is so transparent about the goals and objectives and we all work together as a community, both staff and the Safebodas. Ever since i joined Safeboda, other motorists and pedestrians on the road started to respect me as a professional because Safeboda trained me to be one. My income also greatly increased from the time I joined Safeboda. The list is endless and I can write a full booklet\u2026 (laughs).\n\nHow is it like working for a technology-based company?\n\nWorking in a tech company is as exciting as there\u2019s room for talent growth, exposure I get from the professionals around me makes me a better person every day and there are always problems you solve on a daily basis thus impacting directly or indirectly the end product users.\n\nI have personally learnt so much since I joined Safeboda for example I am now very good at using Microsoft Excel and actually hope to pursue further studies in data science or project management in the future. This has all been inspired by working for Safeboda.\n\nWhat can you say is Safeboda\u2019s greatest/biggest achievement to date?\n\nWhat I would refer to the biggest achievement is that we have revolutionized the whole boda boda transportation system by increasing on the number of safer rides through road safety and the use of technology (mobile app). Safeboda has brought about behavioral change in both the riders and passengers. There\u2019s 100% helmet adoption among Safebodas and they understand and respect the traffic rules. Passengers have also since changed from standing on the road to stop a boda to now just using an app and more they are also wearing helmets.\n\nWhat\u2019s your best Safeboda campaign you have come to love/like since the company\u2019s inauguration?\n\nMy best campaigns are 2;\n\n1. I Found the 1:\n\nI was directly part of this campaign as customer had to request and find me as number 1. I really enjoyed it because it gave me an opportunity to meet and interact with many Safeboda customers while educating them about the value of going cashless. Also because in this campaign I took my last commercial trips as I am now working full time at the Safeboda office to continue to improve our community.\n\n2. Monthly madness:\n\nThis was a very exciting campaign because customers got 100% bonus on the 1st of every month for any amount of credit topped up. This campaign introduced many of us to Safeboda credit and the convenience of riding cashless. We are quickly moving into a cashless so I really enjoyed this campaign\n\nYour opinion on the moto-taxi hailing industry in Uganda and its future?\n\nMoto-taxi hailing industry in Uganda is definitely going to grow stronger and more diversified and competition is likely to be stiffer which is good because more competition means more innovation. In the long run this will promote safer trips, convenience and a much more professional boda boda industry. I look forward to it.\n\nWith the gradual growth of these companies, will Safeboda stand the competition?\n\nWe have proved that we can stand and beat the international companies which are considered to be the best. Once they get into the same market we share and we can still do it because we\u2019re providing local solutions to every market we go to.\n\nSafeboda was built in Uganda for Uganda to create transportation solutions for Ugandans.\n\nSafeboda has one female rider (so far), in your opinion how can the company bring more female riders on board?\n\nWe\u2019re working towards that by professionalizing the industry and once the women know that Safeboda\u2019s are respected, secure and are making more money or equivalent to other professions say teachers, doctors etc., then they will gradually come on board. However this can truly be possible if the society change the way they attach some jobs to gender.\n\nI do however welcome all women seriously interested in joining the industry to come and we can set up a training programme.\n\nA number of reports have been filed of moto-hailing riders getting insulted by regular riders, how can these two parties cooperate?\n\nI think moto-hailing riders should endeavor to educate their colleagues about these companies and how they work. The reason why there have been incidences is because they think moto-hailing riders are taking all the business which isn\u2019t the case. The population of Kampala is approximately over 2 million people meaning there\u2019s still a lot of demand and room for everyone to work.\n\nThey (moto-hailing riders) should also educate them (regular riders) about the benefits so that they join the movement.\n\nI presume the Safeboda app is one of your favorite\u2019s apps, right\u2014what could you say are your favorite mobile applications?\n\nSafeboda apps (customer and driver) come first.\n\nSocial apps most especially Twitter then Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and WhatsApp.\n\nPodbean for the different podcasts I listen to.\n\nSlack for work (internal communication).\n\nGoogle maps.\n\nBecause of your busy schedule, have you thought of having someone manage these platforms for you, Twitter most especially?\n\nThe only management I would like is maybe analyzing what I tweet and giving me feedback on how to improve but\u2014I feel am communicating directly from my heart to the people if am solely running my account.\n\nThank you for your time Moses, any last words?\n\nThank you for this interview and I would like to insist on the helmet wearing; once you make a decision that you\u2019re going to hail a boda. I also urge people to embrace technology and download the Safeboda app and consistently use cashless as this will reduce their transport costs (25% discount) and offer more convenience.[related-posts]", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2019/01/a-sit-down-with-safeboda-pioneer-rider-moses-musinguzi/", "published": "2019-01-09T12:55:11+00:00"}, {"title": "Uganda Driving Permits Revised to be Used Globally", "author": ["Posts On This Account Are Made Various Editors."], "text": "The Minister for Works and Transport, Hon.

And 700 new MDAs/LGs will be connected as well by the end of next financial year 2020/21. Over USD$200 million (roughly UGX757.9 billion) has been generated from commercialization on the National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI) in the last five years. 31 police stations and 9 UPDF sites have been connected to the National Backbone Infrastructure (NBI). Free Wi-Fi connectivity, MyUG is provided to the general public in 284 locations in the Kampala and Entebbe from 5PM to 6AM. The National Broadband Policy 2018 was approved. 17 regulations developed under the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC) Act 2013. The National data centre and disaster recovery site have been upgraded to the Tier 3 classification hosting 60 MDAs, over 90 critical applications and 358 websites. The National strategy on the fourth industrial revolution has been developed to guide the country in the adoption of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and 5G. Government Citizens Interaction Centre (GCIC) has been strengthen to provide social media communication on government programmes. Priority eServices have been developed and are being rolled out in government MDAs. 37 MDAs are using the Unified Messaging and Collaboration System (UMCS). 22 base stations in rural areas upgraded from 2G to 3G to provide internet to over one million Ugandans through RDCF. Free-to-Air network increased TV signal coverage from 20% in 2016 to 60% in 2020 and TV content providers/clients from 24 in 2017 to 40 in 2020.

As most Ugandans begin to return to work, they will be happy to find everything running and the lights on, just like at their respective homes.\n\nBehind all this has been the 1,625 men and women at Umeme; Uganda\u2019s largest power distributor, working together in partnership with the generation and transmission partners, to keep Uganda, especially the healthcare and manufacturing facilities switched on and running.\n\nCovid-19, the deadly disease caused by the coronavirus is now a local and a global reality. I would like to applaud all our frontline healthcare workers and other individuals and institutions who are working day and night under the strategic guidance of our president, to keep this pandemic at bay in Uganda.\n\nAs guided by the President, H.E Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, while the healthcare workers fight the disease, care must be taken to keep the economy running, without compromising public health.\n\nUmeme, accounts for over 97% of all electricity supply in the country and we therefore understand and appreciate that we must stay at work to keep the country switched on and running. I appreciate the efforts of our 1,625 staff and contractors who have remained committed to keeping the lights on. We also appreciate the support received from the security Joint Task Force, which has continued to support us during these tough times.\n\nBut Uganda can only keep the economy running, if we are all healthy and alive, which is why I urge all of us to join hands to fight the coronavirus by adhering to all government directives and guidelines especially staying home and practicing the various safety measures that government has so articulately communicated.\n\nAdjusting our processes to keep Uganda switched on\n\nAt Umeme- the safety of our customers, our staff, and the public has always been a priority. In light of the directives issued by the government, Umeme has had to inevitably make adjustments in our standard operating procedures to protect our staff and subsequently the public, but also ensure we reliably keep on the lights.\n\nFirst of all, to reduce the level of human interaction, we have had to scale down on the number of staff coming to work physically. This has seen us reduce the number of staff per shift. To fit within the 12-hour night curfew, we have also had to create longer shifts of 12 hours in our contact centre and work management centre. We have further relocated staff required to be at work to service centers nearest to their places of residence.\n\nThe staff rationalizations however do not affect the technical teams. We have maintained the usual technical teams who attend to faults in Kampala, Entebbe & Mukono areas. Our entire upcountry faults teams are also fully operational. The specialized teams that attend to big breakdowns and vital installations such as factories, healthcare facilities, security installations, and other vital facilities are on standby.\n\nThe decongestion on our roads has also allowed us to respond to emergencies and technical faults faster and timelier. This is why for example even with the reduced workforce, our service levels remain high.\n\nUmeme keeping health and manufacturing facilities running\n\nMost referral health facilities, except Mulago National Referral Hospital, do not have dedicated power lines. They share these power lines with other users in the community in which these facilities are located. To ensure maximum efficiency during this delicate period, Umeme carried out preventive inspections and maintenance on these lines and the supporting substations to enhance their performance. We have also made sure that any emerging faults on these lines are prioritized ahead of other faults for faster restoration of supply.\n\nA Umeme ground transformer in Tororo, near the Simba Cement Factory. Courtesy Photo\n\nAlso the pre-paid meters to health facilities were replenished with credit to ensure continuity of supply without disconnection.\n\nThe continued investment in the distribution grid has significantly contributed to its stability and reliability. For this year, the plan is to invest a further USD$80 million in substations, line works, and expansion of distribution zones. We also aim to convert the remaining 150,000 postpaid customers to pre-paid metering.\n\nProtecting Umeme Staff and their families\n\nFor the safety of our staff, Umeme complies with the Ministry of Health Guidelines on covid-19 and has provided the required personal protective equipment like working goggles, hand sanitizers, vehicle sanitizers, and gloves, etc. Our field technical teams are under strict instructions to adhere to Ministry of Health guidelines while attending to network operations and technical customer service requests.\n\nAn Umeme Field Technician attends to a customer. The power distributor has maintained its technical teams who attend to faults in Kampala, Entebbe & Mukono areas. Courtesy Photo\n\nWe urge the public to boost the efficacy of these initiatives by equally practicing the ministry of health guidelines, especially maintaining the recommended 4 meters social distance while dealing with our staff.\n\nThe investments in technology have enabled us to continue serving our customers through the use of digital channels at our contact centre, payments through digital channels, remote network management through the use of SCADA and remote working of our staff. Our operations would have been significantly derailed during the lockdown period if we had not embraced technology over the years.\n\nLet us stay safe, stay home, and save lives.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article is written and provided by Mr. Selestino Babungi; Managing Director at Umeme LTD.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2020/05/umeme-during-this-covid-19-crisis/", "published": "2020-05-26T12:56:24+00:00"}, {"title": "NRM Manifesto Week: ICT Sector Pledges and President\u2019s Directives", "author": [], "text": "The ruling Government, the NRM through its NRM Manifesto 2016-2021 released its twelve (12) pledges for the ICT sector including H.E President\u2019s Museveni\u2019s directives.\n\nThe NRM manifesto week is when Ministries come out to showcase the sector\u2019s achievements over the last four years.

In 2016, the company plans to release 31 new and returning original series, two dozen original feature films and documentaries, a wide range of stand-up comedy specials and 30 original kids series, available at the same time to members everywhere.\n\nUgandans took to social media to express their thoughts on the news of the availability of Netflix in Uganda, with several excited about the development but some expressing reservations.\n\nThe way @Airtel_Ug eats Data.p\u2019ple excited about Netflix won\u2019t evn read the Director\u2019s Name be4 the Message: You have used 100% of your Data \u2014 Samwise Gamgee (@Sambannz) January 7, 2016\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the NRM Government for bringing Netflix to Uganda and Africa at Large #SteadyProggress. \u2014 Jeff 3.1.5\u2122 (@andsjeff) January 7, 2016\n\nNetflix coming to Uganda is what we have been waiting for. But the question is, Will it be #NeflixAndChill or #NetflixAndBuffering ??? \u2014 Waiswa Batambuze (@IBatambuze) January 7, 2016\n\nOne of the main concerns is the speed and cost of internet here, since the subscription price is only part of the cost of accessing the video content.\n\nWith video settings at \u201cMedium\u201d which shows standard video quality, you\u2019re set back about 0.7 GB per hour, making it over 1 GB for an average 90 minute movie. At a rate of UGX 12,500 per GB when you buy a 10 GB bundle from MTN Uganda, Vodafone, or Airtel Uganda, in less than 3 hours of watching you will have spent more in internet costs than the monthly Netflix subscription that starts at $7.99 (approximately UGX 27,000).\n\nThis means that although you have access to unlimited TV shows and movies in Ultra HD for only UGX 33,800, it will cost you a minimum of UGX 18,000 per 90 minute movie or UGX 8,000 per episode of Blacklist you watch in HD. This cost is if you are subscribed to Vodafone\u2019s \u201cUnlimited\u201d 6 Mbps package capped at 50GB, but the figure shoots up quickly when you buy a smaller bundle say the 10 GB we referenced earlier to about UGX 56,200 for a movie and UGX 25,000 for an episode of How to get away with Murder.\n\nThe other bottleneck that we envisage with enjoying the full capacity of Netflix is hardware as many devices we have in our homes aren\u2019t HD capable. Netflix allows you to watch on a wide range of devices, but most TVs on the market here aren\u2019t capable of viewing HD let alone Ultra HD. Not many users have streaming devices, gaming consoles or other compatible devices so many users here will be limited to standard or basic video quality.\n\nAt first glance the availability of Netflix seems like a threat to DSTV who recently had the public up in arms when they hiked subscription rates, but when you look at the details, DSTV won\u2019t be going down too easily.\n\nNetflix has not yet been made available in China, Crimea, North Korea and Syria due to U.S. government restrictions on American companies.\n\nSince Netflix launched its streaming service in 2007, the service has expanded globally, first to Canada, then to Latin America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan to include 60 countries.\n\nYou can try out Netflix for free for one month by signing up at www.netflix.com but it requires that you enter payment information, either a credit/debit card or PayPal. Additional payment methods would go a long way to increase uptake in specific regions. For example in Uganda, adding Mobile Money payment option would open it up to many more users than Visa and PayPal.\n\nLet us know in the comments what your thoughts are on the arrival of Netflix in Uganda.[related-posts]", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2016/01/netflix-now-available-in-uganda-but-dont-get-too-excited-yet/", "published": "2016-01-07T10:10:58+00:00"}, {"title": "Tecno Boom J8 review: Unboxing & first impressions", "author": ["Jeddy", "The Jedi", "Is A Budding Professional With Extensive Conceptual Knowledge In Web Development Technologies", "Computer Systems.", "In Like", "With The Internet Startup Space", "Cloud Computing.

Still on audio, the J8 comes with the Boom Maxx app to amplify the music experience.\n\nThe dual SIM support is going to be great for globetrotters out there who constantly switch SIM cards or perhaps use lots of prepaid data overseas. The fact that it supports for 4G LTE data and voice on dual SIM is a big bonus.\n\nThe new HiOS customized operating system makes the device quite fluid in terms of performance.\n\nLast, the new design gives the phone a more stable and solid feel with the metal bezel.\n\nI should have a full review of this in a week or two but for now, the Boom J8 definitely seems like one of the best budget deals right now.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2016/04/tecno-boom-j8-review-unboxing-first-impressions/", "published": "2016-04-29T10:34:13+00:00"}, {"title": "Uganda Technology News, Analysis, Software and Product Reviews from Africa's Oldest ICT Magazine", "author": ["Posts On This Account Are Made Various Editors."], "text": "There has been robust growth in Internet access and usage over the past few years and Africa is now primed to take advantage of the social and economic opportunities that the Internet can bring to people across the continent. This was the focus of an address delivered to delegates at the Africa Internet Summit (AIS) being held in Tunisia by Kathy Brown, President & CEO of the Internet Society.\n\nIn her speech, delivered to AIS participants in Tunis today, Ms. Brown highlighted the progress made in recent years to bring improved Internet access and availability to more people in Africa, noting how the this growth provides a strong foundation for stimulating opportunity through an enabling environment defined by inclusion, innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s recent economic growth rates and growing entrepreneurial spirit are combining to create a climate of opportunity,\u201d said Ms. Brown. \u201cAdvances in Internet infrastructure and the meteoric rise of the mobile Internet have already transformed the African technology landscape. I believe that Africa\u2019s Internet is now at a tipping point, poised for further positive change and expansion as the continent looks forward with confidence to the future.\u201d\n\nShe added, however, that there are still barriers which must be overcome in order to capture the full economic and social promise of the Internet. While connectivity is on the rise and available bandwidth in Africa has increased significantly, challenges for the African Internet business ecosystem still include factors such as the cost of broadband, online fraud, lack of local content and fragmented markets.\n\n\u201cAfrica is now the frontier for the next wave of Internet progress,\u201d continued Ms. Brown. \u201cWhile there is huge potential for Africa to continue building an Internet that will best serve its needs and its people, it is critical that true collaboration across Africa\u2019s technical community, a culture of innovation and a spirit of entrepreneurship form part of this process. The Internet Society stands with Africa to continue the great momentum underway to overcome challenges and enable the economic and social possibilities that only a truly open, trusted Internet can deliver.\u201d", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2015/06/africa-primed-to-take-advantage-of-the-internet-opportunity-internet-society-ceo-kathy-brown/", "published": "2015-06-02T11:30:05+00:00"}, {"title": "Access MTN Services gets smarter with MyMTN app", "author": ["Award-Winning Founder Ceo Of Pc Tech Magazine", "Managing Director - Adnote Advertising", "Secretary General Of Uganda Ict Association.

Telecommunications services have evolved; from GSM/PDMA calls to VoIP calls that most of us know as WhatsApp and/or Viber calls; from SMS to IM; and now from airtime purchases to bank [money] transfers using Mobile Money.\n\nThe advent of all these services has prompted (or necessitated) the regulator, Uganda Communications Commission to adopt a standardization criteria, requiring operators across the sector to use exactly the same USSD code for particular services. Helplines for example. Not that all such changes make sense; but it reinforces one point: the codes to remember are now way too many. *100#, *165#, *147#, *150*1#, e.t.c\n\nTo save us the headache, operators have decided to innovate. MTN Uganda recently announced the Android-based \u201cMTN Assistant\u201c which centralized most of MTN\u2019s most popular services onto one dashboard.\n\nAnd now MTN has introduced a more robust mobile app. MTN 1App is available on all major stores: Google Play, Blackberry, Windows Phone Store and Apple Store. It\u2019s the most robust we\u2019ve seen so far.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the world of services to suit everyone\u2019s needs. With MTN 1App you can topup airtime, purchase bundles pay your bills and much more,\u201d reads the \u201cDescription\u201d on the app\u2019s Google Play page.\n\nThe App is available on Google Play, Blackberry, Windows and Apple store. Visit your AppStore and search for MTN1App #MTN1App \u2014 MTN Uganda (@mtnug) July 1, 2015\n\nThe app literally brings everything in one place. MTN1App gives subscribers greater control of their own mobile services so that they can access services and solve issues without having to contact company representatives.\n\nDesign\n\nIn three words; the design is fresh, sleek and modern. This review is based on tests on iPhone and Android platforms. The app features MTN\u2019s brand colors of deep yellow with a brown-ish theme. The welcome screen features a group selfie of very happy people, getting the user off to a pleasant start.\n\nFeatures\n\nProminently displayed on the homescreen are to shortcuts; MySelfService and Mobile Money. Either selection takes you to a login page, crucially making security an integral to the app.\n\nThe choice of those two blocks as the major service categories says something about the future that MTN sees: in that future, Mobile Money will be as important as, if not more than, all the other services combined.\n\nOn the MySelfService screen, the Main Account [airtime] balance is queried and displayed automatically, as well as the data balance. The other shortcuts reveal MTN\u2019s services and product offerings, Loyalty points if any, Data bundles and the Tariff Plan Advisor which, I noticed, offers a recommendation of a plan and why. And an option to call customer care; crucially, without dialing any more buttons. Just a click of a button. Beat that!\n\nBack on the App Homepage, the Mobile Money option has squeezed all MTN Mobile Money features in one place. Airtime purchases, bill payments, and money transfers.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: I noticed that the app stores my most recent bill payments and gives me the option to tap and make the same payment without having to go through the trouble of re-entering the digits. This is convenient for services such as PayTV and Utility Bills.\n\nMTN 1App also ensures customers have access to information about MTN\u2019s products and services whenever the user needs it (24 hours a day) and at their convenience.\n\nSecurity\n\nAt two of the most key levels, the app requires authentication and the sessions timeout after the phone has been left idle for a few minutes, at which point it requires the owner to re-enter passwords.\n\nConclusion\n\nMTN 1App is an altogether exciting application for users of MTN services. For once, one may not have to remember any stars and hashes to access services.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2015/07/mtn-services-get-smarter-with-mtn-1app-review/", "published": "2015-07-01T21:59:23+00:00"}, {"title": "Digital Migration: After 20 years with Windows, I am moving to Ubuntu", "author": ["Husband", "Father", "Geek", "Petrolhead", "Serial Entrepreneur.

Managing Director Twinsource."], "text": "After over 20 years of using Windows, I have decided to ditch Windows 8 and try out Ubuntu as my main OS.\n\nOn 30th September 2015, Kampala was host to two international ICT conferences. The International ICT BPO Conference took place at the Kampala Serena Hotel and attracted a wide variety of participants, ranging from students studying IT at the various Ugandan universities to visitors from faraway lands. Several delegates flew in that morning from Nairobi after the close of the Indo-Africa Expo the previous day. I was on the team of 15 Ugandans who attended the conference and exhibited at the expo, with support from the ITC NTF III project, and we flew back Tuesday night so that we could attend the conferences.\n\nMeanwhile at the shores of Lake Victoria was the Innovation Africa Summit at the Speke Resort Munyonyo which I also attended. The IA2015 Summit was well attended by high level officials from over 40 countries, speaking more than 4 languages. At some point we had a panel of 4 speaking 3 languages, so we actually got to use the headsets.\n\nMicrosoft was one of the partners of the Summit, and had a booth where they were showcasing their efforts towards ICT in Education. I arrived quite early on the 2nd day and as I strolled around I ended up at the Microsoft booth, and the gentleman in the booth at that time welcomed me and invited me to take a look around, handed me an info pack and we got into a conversation:\n\nMr Microsoft: What do you think about this software that we\u2019re rolling out for use in institutions?\n\nMe: Since its Microsoft I guess it\u2019s gonna be great, and it will serve the students and institutions well.\n\nMr Microsoft: *After a brief hesitation, probably trying to decide whether it was a sarcastic remark or a sincere complement* Correct answer! *laughs heartily and gives me a high five*\n\nMe: BTW I\u2019m not just saying this to be polite since I\u2019m in your booth, I actually believe that with your history you will put out a great product, just like you\u2019ve done with your other products.\n\nMr Microsoft: Thank you! You know we do our best, we\u2019re not perfect but we learn from our mistakes and improve. Because we\u2019re often trailblazers, we have to make some mistakes ourselves along the way but we quickly learn and come back stronger. Take Windows Vista for example, we learnt the mistakes from that and Windows 7 was a resounding success\u2026 *blah blah*\n\nI agreed with what he was saying, indeed there have been some Windows versions that suck and some that have been great. For instance Windows 3.1 (ok I just mentioned that one because that\u2019s where my journey started!). Windows 7 was such a great OS that I refused to upgrade until I forcefully got onto Windows 8 when I bought a new laptop and found that all PCs had Windows 8.\n\nIt was fine initially, I couldn\u2019t decide whether I liked it or not, but apart from the dramatic touch screen like menu, it seemed to be Windows 7 in a new dress / suit. No major issues. Not even minor ones actually, it just worked like it should. This is one of the reasons I had expressed my confidence in Microsoft.\n\nThen several months down the road, my computer started slowing down, and in several instances it ground to a halt, I couldn\u2019t do anything. The thought that came to my mind was how much (or how little, for that matter) I\u2019d spent on the PC. I kept telling myself that next time I\u2019m buying a laptop, I shouldn\u2019t use the strategy of walking into one of my favourite computer shops on Kampala Road and asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the cheapest laptop you\u2019ve got here? Is it a Toshiba? Or Dell? Or HP? Great. Can you top up the RAM to 4GB? Great. Where do I pay?\u201d.\n\nYes I always negotiate for a RAM upgrade because for some reason manufacturers still ship computers with 2GB RAM. I mean, seriously??!!!\n\nAnyway, back to the Windows situation. It turned out my system was slowing down because something which I\u2019m yet to identify was sucking up all my system resources randomly. I say randomly because I\u2019ve not yet been able to identify any pattern or triggers. A process called \u201cService Host\u201d keeps using up more and more RAM until it has used up all of it. Then when I disconnect internet, It slowly gets back to normal. Until I connect again. Then I try rebooting. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Sadly, this has happened before in the many years I\u2019ve used Windows, situations which require reinstalling as the solution. Infact at campus we used to memorize product keys because the frequent re-installations of Windows XP!\n\nI then remembered that I had recently made several tweets that poked fun at the ruling party and I quickly concluded that the government had successfully installed spyware and was funneling my data to their servers in Mbuya or Bombo or wherever it is that they have those Citizen Spyware things set up.\n\nPromising \u201ccrime preventers\u201d pay for rally #ItsEasy but keeping it a secret not easy! https://t.co/O4RMNPVZqH \u2014 JoshTwin (@josh_twin) November 6, 2015\n\nThen I googled and realized it was a more widespread problem, but solutions weren\u2019t nearly as plentiful as the complaints and user reports. I have since talked to a few more people locally who are being affected by the same issue.\n\nThen out of the blue, it hit me: Linux. Yes I just said Linux after telling a Microsoft rep that they rock!\n\nI first used Linux dressed as Ubuntu a few years ago when I was in programming class. Everyone said \u201cyou need Linux\u201d. I\u2019d managed to avoid it all my computing life but this time round I bowed to pressure, and set up a dual boot so that I could fit in when in class, then get back to Windows when in real life. I\u2019d actually shut down Linux when leaving school and boot Windows!\n\nThen I let go of the laptop some time ago. You see, one of the advantages of buying the cheapest laptop is that you can quickly sell it on OLX or Trade Links Africa and get good cash to buy the latest version of the cheapest laptops. This particular one was sold within 1 hour of posting on my Facebook page!\n\nAfter careful consideration, consultation and preparation (read: thinking about it for a few minutes), I have decided I\u2019m going to switch to Ubuntu this weekend.\n\nI\u2019m going to write about the \u201cmigration\u201d process so that if any of the people I advised to buy a Windows PC want to follow in my footsteps they have the details at their fingertips. For the start I\u2019m going to set up a dual boot so that I can keep my options open, you know what they say about the color of grass on the other side of the fence! But once I\u2019ve confirmed that all the programs I need can run, I\u2019ll put Windows 8 on hold.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering why I shouldn\u2019t upgrade to Windows 10, let me take this opportunity to inform you that I considered that! I talked to a few people who had taken the plunge but the general impression was \u201cGive it a little while, maybe the next update will be better\u201d. Talk of Wi-Fi connectivity issues, requiring frequent restarts etc were enough to convince me to leave it alone for a while.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first saga I\u2019ve had with Windows, I\u2019ve used windows since Windows 3.1, and like I mentioned earlier, I have at some point memorized product keys because we had to re-install regularly. Yes regularly. So this is just the last straw really.\n\nMy next post will be about the Linux installation which I\u2019m going to embark on this weekend.", "link": "https://pctechmag.com/2015/11/digital-migration-after-20-years-with-windows-i-am-moving-to-ubuntu/", "published": "2015-11-13T10:38:11+00:00"}]}, "TECH JAJA": {"link": "https://techjaja.com/", "articles": [{"title": "How to enjoy YouTube videos without viewing any ads \u2013 Techjaja", "author": ["Techjaja Staff", "A Techjaja 'Bot' Profile"], "text": "A Redditor has posted a simple way of watching YouTube videos in a web browser without any ads.

They will be entering into a streaming deal with both Netflix and Amazon to add both services into its upcoming Explora device. The service will be piloted in South Africa initially but it will spread to the rest of Africa later on in the year.\n\nThis means DStv customers who own the Explora decoder model will be able to watch Netflix and Amazon Prime Video if they wish to subscribe to them.\n\nMultichoice will need to position the business for the future, leverage the group\u2019s scale, and enhance the product ecosystem by providing access to a wider variety of content, the group recently concluded distribution agreements with two major international Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) providers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn addition to this deal, MultiChoice provided more information regarding its upcoming DStv Now standalone streaming service.\n\nALSO READ: DSTV Now set to be a standalone service like Netflix in 2020\n\nIn order to get onto the popular streaming bandwagon, Multichoice decided to sign distribution agreements with two major international subscription video-on-demand services. They couldn\u2019t reveal much since they are still in a pre-release embargo period with both of these international players. So they couldn\u2019t go into the specifics until the formal consumer release.\n\nSo what happens to ShowMax?\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe company has however promised to share more information in the next few weeks, which will include details on how consumers will interface and engage with content from these streaming services. They also confirm that the agreement formed part of a new unified streaming platform MultiChoice would launch that would include content from international players.\n\nEach of the different service providers has very specific content that sits on their platform, and ShowMax content typically doesn\u2019t overlap that much with these other content providers. So the company is trying to is to provide an amount of simplicity, choice, and convenience to subscribers \u2013 they can come to one place and can get access to all of this different content.\n\nThe move by Multichoice is no different from the broadcast content aggregation they have has been doing for years \u2013 this time it is just done via an over-the-top (OTT) streaming platform.\n\nWhere does this leave DStv Now?\n\nWith over 19.5 million subscribers, it is no surprise that these large international streaming platforms were attracted to partner with MultiChoice and DStv.\n\nPenetrating the African market is not as easy as it seems for these streaming services, especially given our low internet penetration numbers. It seems Multichoice is confident and the agreement with DStv makes a lot of sense to them, too.\n\nAccording to the financials released in January this year, Netflix has over 52 million from the Africa, MiddleEast, Europe, and Asia (AMEA) region. It also reported stronger-than-expected financials, with revenue of $5.47 billion and earnings per share of $1.30, compared to analyst estimates of $5.45 billion and EPS of 53 cents.\n\nALSO READ: Netflix enters 2020 with 52 million paid subscribers in AMEA region\n\nBut how will all these affect DStv Now? The company will still offer DStv Now. It is not going to go away any time soon, but alongside that, they promised that it has a more slick and more developed component of linear television that represents itself in the streaming product. This means customers will decide for themselves how they want to watch.", "link": "https://techjaja.com/here-is-what-to-expect-from-the-multichoice-netflix-and-amazon-prime-video-streaming-deal/", "published": "2020-06-11T07:58:55+00:00"}, {"title": "KCCA's new public transport route map is like an underground Metro railway system Kampala will never have \u2013 Techjaja", "author": ["Roger Bambino", "The Love For Gadgets", "Technology Is Deeply Rooted In His Dna", "He Is A Blogger", "Really Obsessed With Cool Devices.

This was the first thought that popped into my mind when I saw Kampala City Council Authority\u2019s (KCCA) new public transport route that taxi and bus operators started using with effect from 4th June after H.E the President announced that they will resume operations after weeks of lockdown. The multi-colored straight lines on the map can give an illusion of a future high tech transportation system that Kampala dwellers can only dream of. One would only wish we had such an underground railway system in Kampala.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMy first underground travel experience was in Paris 2012, I was amazed at how the system works. The Paris Metro opened on 19 July 1900, and the subway has grown gradually, inaugurating the last line in 1998. This line is considered one of the most modern worldwide. Currently, Paris Metro has 303 lines and is 136 miles (219 km) long. It\u2019s so organized in such a way that passengers can use the same travel card and the difference between the underground and train is barely noticeable.\n\nA functioning mass transit system is most important to back up mobility in large cities and conglomerations. Many other countries like the USA, UK, Singapore, China, etc have a similar transportation system due to the high people and vehicle traffic in those cities.\n\nAn Underground Metro System\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSuch a system will reduce on the traffic jam, reduce unnecessary road accidents, and provide cheap transportation (if subsidized by the government) among the various merits that come with a metro subway system.\n\nUnderstanding the new Public transportation Routes\n\nNow back to our reality, KCCA\u2019s new public transport route is well thought of and squeaky clean\u2013 having well-demarcated routes with bus stop numbers to clearly guide passengers and drivers to their destination. Kampala\u2019s day population is about 5 million and 2 million by night. This implies that about 3 million people come in and out of the city on a daily basis.\n\nAccording to the new arrangement, the Central Business District (CDB) lines A, B, C F, H, I, M, N P, Q, S, U, and Y will operate in the Old Taxi Park while taxis operating on Line C, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, and S will operate from the New Taxi Park. Usafi taxi park will have taxis operating on lines N, P, R, S, and U while Kisenyi taxi park will have Lines P and S. The V lines will operate from the Natete park while the X lines are reserved for metropolitan bus services only. See below\n\nCentral Business District (CDB) taxi routes\n\nLet\u2019s give an example, If you are going to Nansana you have two route options; one can use taxis operating on line L2 from the Central Business District (CDB) via Bakuli, Nakulabye to Wakiso or H4 from the CDB via Makerere and Kasubi. All the routes are well organized but will take a bit of a steep learning curve for passengers to know where to get which taxi to take them to their final destinations. It also ensures drivers know their routes of operation and drive only in those routes as registered with KCCA.\n\nThe taxi operators are required to pay the mandatory fees for a PSV license, have a renewal of driving permit if expired and third party insurance. They also had to pay other government fees by 31st Dec 2020 giving them a grace period of six (6) months. The six months grace period which expires 31st Dec 2020 is to allow public transport operators to obtain a permanent route chart, color code for GKMA, and other user fees. Effective 1st January 2021, all vehicles that would have not complied shall not be permitted to operate in the GKMA.\n\n\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWe recommend KCCA to make an app for the detailed route map to ease life of the passengers.\n\nThe Detailed Map\n\nKampala Transportation Routes (Metro)\n\nPossible challenges of a Metro in Kampala\n\nHowever much I would love our beautiful city surrounded by seven hills to have a great underground metro system to ease transportation and cut on the traffic jam situation above the ground, our government is not ready to embark on such a complex project. As Ugandans, we seem to prioritize on the now and forget and not the fur future. Other experts have argued that making Kampala a futuristic city is close to impossible now. We would be better off with a whole new city, but if you would insist on Kampala, we would opt for an overground or hybrid metro-system like in Dubai.\n\nWe would face several challenges as a country if we were to embark on such a huge project. This includes; funding, corruption, engineering construction challenges, unstable power system, environmental impact, underground noise or air pollution, natural hazards, the establishment of laws and regulations for safety risk management, and underground metro robberies. The list is endless.\n\nLet\u2019s also consider Metro subway station fires that often have serious consequences because of the high density of people and a limited number of exits in a relatively enclosed space. The urgent demands for land resources in urban development, more and more underground spaces, such as subway metro stations, underground malls, parking lots, water, Optic fiber cable and so on, are explored and constructed. Due to the compact structure, high population density, limited number of exits, and other factors, serious consequences can be induced by disasters in subway stations, which have become a great public concern.\n\nALSO READ: Full specifications of the Kayoola EVS\u2122 Buses that have hit the streets of Kampala\n\nBoda bodas still play a crucial role\n\nLet\u2019s not forget our boda boda friends. The Boda Bodas play a critical role in transporting a good number of people in the city but they need to be regulated to enhance the safety of the public. We know that the government is in the process of finalizing the extent of a boda boda Freezone and the gazetting of boda boda stages in the City. According to KCCA, future Boda boda operations will also be subjected to Standard Operating Procedures. Gazetting of stages and their return to the city will be communicated in due course.\n\nIn conclusion, as a developing nation all this is just a dream, but still in the grasp of our future generations. This requires governments that have long term plans to predict and the zeal to implement futuristic transportation in Kampala or how any new city will look like in the next 50 years.

There are many websites that are very popular but are hidden away and you cannot find them by searching your popular search engines. That space is where the Dark Web and the Deep Web exist.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo understand the Dark Web or Darknet, we need to first attempt to define it more. Its is composed of many websites on an encrypted network with hidden IP addresses \u2013 all of which gives users strong anonymity protection. In simple terms, no one can see what you are doing while you are there.\n\nWhen one opens up a website, they strive to ensure that the site is indexed by search engines like Google, Bing or Yandex, but for the dark web, you can only access them with special anonymity browsers, which include Freenet, I2P, and The Onion Router also known as TOR browser.\n\nDark Web Vs Deep Web\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThese two are always confused. The Deep Web is all the sites on the web that can\u2019t be reached with a search engine. Although this includes sites on the Dark Web, it also includes sites that serve more mundane functions, such as business intranets, webmail platforms, databases, online banking platforms, and services that usually require a password or other means of authentication.\n\nThese are found and accessed directly with a URL or IP address and are hidden behind firewalls, paywalls, and HTML forms. Because all these other pages are included in the Deep Web, the Deep Web is actually far more vast than the regular internet (also known as the Clear Web).\n\nIs it illegal?\n\nUsers of the Dark Web are assured of full anonymity but this also yields a great breeding ground for illegal activities. They use this space to buy or sell illegal goods such as stolen data, unprescribed drugs, or dangerous weapons.\n\nThe Dark Web can also be used for legitimate reasons. We have seen whistleblowers, activists, journalists, and others who need to share sensitive information, especially on political figures. This has made it popular as a lot in exposing information that would have not been known to the public for fear of political persecution or retribution by their government or other powerful actors.\n\nIn some countries, security and intelligence agencies also use it to monitor terror groups and track cybercriminals. In what may come as a surprise to many, corporate IT departments frequently crawl the Dark Web in search of stolen data and compromised accounts, and individuals may use it to look for signs of identity theft.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOne of the most defining era of the Dark web was during the times of WikiLeaks \u2013 the website that publishes classified official materials \u2013 which also has a home on the Dark Web. Big companies like Facebook also maintain some form of presence there in order to make itself accessible in countries where it is censored by the government.\n\nGood things you can do on the Dark web\n\nExpose abuses of power Buy restricted good Exchange information in countries with internet censorship Simply use the internet anonymously Buy legal goods anonymously\n\nHow to safely access the Dark web\n\nThere are many ways to access the Dark web, but the most popular one is Tor browser. It used a highly secured network of volunteer relays around the world through which users\u2019 internet connections pass through.\n\nYou will need to download and install the Tor browser bundle. Tor URLs end in the domain.onion and not domain.com. Website addresses here are not simple to memorize and they often change their URLs in order to evade detection and DDoS attacks.\n\nWhen you\u2019re on the Dark Web, ISPs \u2013 and by extension, the government \u2013 might not be able to view your activity, but they will know you are on the Tor Network. This alone is enough to raise eyebrows in some countries.\n\nIt is very paramount that you access the Dark Web while using a VPN before going through the Tor Network. With this method, your ISP only sees the encrypted VPN traffic, and won\u2019t know you\u2019re on the Tor network.\n\nWe recommend you use a trusted VPN provider, one that doesn\u2019t track your activities when you log on. Finally, always connect to your VPN first before opening the Tor browser.\n\nGet a trusted VPN provider and run it Download and install Tor browser bundle Look for the Tor Browser folder and click on the \u201cStart Tor Browser\u201d file inside it. Click on the \u201cConnect\u201d option to open the browser window. Start browsing.onion websites\n\nPrecautions and Safety\n\nIf you want to remain totally secure on the Dark Web, you should take the following extra security measures including:\n\nNever use your real name or photos\n\nNever use an email address or even a password that you have used before\n\nInstead, use an anonymous encrypted email account and aliases that you have never used before and that cannot be traced to you\n\nDisconnect from the internet before opening documents downloaded", "link": "https://techjaja.com/the-dark-web-explained-and-how-to-access-it/", "published": "2020-06-06T07:31:05+00:00"}, {"title": "How to keep your WhatsApp group safe and sane \u2013 Techjaja", "author": ["Farooq Gessa Mousal", "Techjaja"], "text": "Most of us use WhatsApp and in one way or another, we also subscribe to some of the random WhatsApp groups.

As a Kampala resident, I\u2019ve had a chance to test out this 4G network for at least a week now and get a better feel for the early days of the company\u2019s commercial 4G. There has been a lot of excitement around the company\u2019s data deals and as we promised, we decided to fill in the missing pieces from our previous articles \u2014 and that is data speeds that one would expect. Now please note that we did our tests when the network is still in its infant stages so it means there are fewer subscribers and no network congestions which gives a clear indication on the network\u2019s maximum capabilities.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nLycamobile Uganda\u2019s 4G-LTE network runs on either 800 MHz or 1800 Mhz frequency bands depending on location and the latter offers more coverage, but it doesn\u2019t have all the speed and bandwidth benefits that 4G has been promising to bring unlike the former. Its 2G network runs on 1800 MHz\u2013but by default, a phone will always be in 4G mode and when one makes or receives a call, an SMS or sends a USSD code request, they will be switched back to 2G, a terminology known as Circuit Switched Fall Back (CSFB).\n\nAfter testing for about a week with my Huawei Mate 30 Pro, I found myself impressed with the speeds, latency, coverage, and network improvements made by Lycamobile Uganda after acquiring the struggling Tangerine. Most network operators have raced to complete their 4G networks in Uganda. Defunct Orange telecom launched Uganda\u2019s first commercial 4G FD-LTE network on 31st July 2013 beating MTN Uganda after the telecom giant rolled out its network with the less popular frequency 4G TD-LTE technology in the same year. MTN later launched its commercial 4G FD-LTE network on 9th July 2015 and that is when the battle of 4G-LTE networks began in Uganda.\n\nLyamobile Uganda\u2019s Speed and Coverage\n\n@LycamobileUG 4G-LTE speeds tests live in action. @oquidave here is what you requested pic.twitter.com/rubX3BUzID \u2014 roger bambino (@rogekk) April 29, 2020\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nI won\u2019t dwell much on the coverage of Lycamobile Uganda, we wrote a full post on this so in case you missed the memo, read this first. Unlike 3G technology, speed has always been the most obvious 4G benefit. I saw some truly impressive 4G speeds during my first few hours of testing in Kampala and its suburbs, but I haven\u2019t been able to replicate them with consistency. On average, I\u2019d say speeds were around 18 Mbps in most 4G coverage areas. That\u2019s still an impressive jump over the 3G speeds. It should be noted that most people are not in the city due to the lockdown and recent Google stats on internet usage in Uganda confirms that. These areas in Kampala have become choke points for 4G and other networks during morning commutes, but just outside Kampala areas like Kiwatule, Kawempe, Munyonyo, Kireka and Najeera, I recorded an average of 20Mbps on 4G vs. 1 Mbps to 5 Mbps on 4G on other networks.\n\nLower speed tests\n\nAlong the Gaba road, I was able to consistently record speeds in excess of 17.5 Mbps during busy times of the day. A lot of the time these speeds would even break past 18Mbps. These seem to be the consistent 4G top speeds for a fresh network in all the big areas covered in Kampala, but I could occasionally hit 20Mbps and sometimes beyond. I recorded 24 Mbps on a single occasion, but I was never able to reach that speed again during my subsequent tests.\n\nHigher Speed tests\n\nI\u2019ve been impressed with Lyamobile Uganda\u2019s 4G coverage, though my 4G signal at home is inconsistent I managed to get usable speeds. Large parts of Kampala and even its suburbs are covered. I was able to tether the Huawei Mate 30 Pro to a laptop over Wi-Fi and get speeds of around 14 Mbps at a petrol station in town one day. I did find that the tethering speed didn\u2019t always match the higher speeds found directly on the phone, though, unless you\u2019re using direct USB tethering.\n\nTethering is where you\u2019re really able to see how well 4G can perform, and the speeds can dip and fluctuate a lot when you\u2019re downloading larger files. I found on smaller files the speeds would remain consistent and allow me to download them quickly, but I tried to download a Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft\u2019s speedy download servers and although it started off at around 13MB/s, it dipped to 500KB/s after a couple of minutes.\n\nWith these download speeds, I\u2019ve been able to scrub through 1080p HDR YouTube videos within minutes, and download entire episodes of Netflix TV shows or albums from Spotify much faster than I could on many Wi-Fi hotspots in Kampala. I wouldn\u2019t say the download speeds have been life-changing just yet, but if the upload speeds matched them then it would transform my ability to work anywhere.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe most disappointing part of my tests has been the measly upload speeds. The promise of 4G has always been about speed, but I\u2019ve barely been able to hit an average of 5 Mbps in most upload speed tests, which has made me rethink the dream of a remote office. I was getting upload speeds as low as 800 kbps. The current 4G uploads on network maxed out at 7.24 Mbps and the speeds are so much lower than the download links. On a brighter side, the 7 Mbps uploads on Lycamobile Uganda is faster than some download speeds of competitor 4G networks.\n\nData Usage\n\nMy big concern around 4G is data usage. During my first day of testing, I used up ~5GB of my 100GB UG Giga data bundle just on speed tests alone. That\u2019s an incredible amount of mobile data, and I would have chewed through Lycamobile Uganda\u2019s Ug Super 10GB data plan at UGX 10,000 a month with this phone within just a few hours. With these speeds, a 10GB data plan isn\u2019t going to cut it for 4G, and you\u2019d need at least 100GB of data a month to really get the benefits of this new network. Lycamobile\u2019s maximum plans are the UG Student and UG Giga at 100GB of 4G data at UGX 30,000 and UGX 45,000 per month respectively.\n\nI hope Lycamobile Uganda will work around offering music or video data passes that can be put in within a monthly bundle, which means streaming data from services like Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music, and Netflix won\u2019t count to your monthly data cap. Well, a guy can only dream! This would feel very icky compared to just offering unlimited data deals.\n\nIt is clear that Lycamobile Uganda is competitive and people are currently flocking their offices to acquire SIM cards. The pricing is indeed very competitive giving us after data 4G experience on the go. Data caps and expensive monthly contracts will only hold back the progress of high-speed networks and the potential for gigabit 5G networks to reach homes in Uganda in the future.\n\nBattery life and network oddities\n\nAnother concern I had around 4G was the impact on battery life. During my testing with the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, I found that those concerns were unwarranted: battery life wasn\u2019t impacted majorly by 4G. The Mate 30 Pro has a large 4,500mAh battery inside, and even with a 4G connection for most of its usage, I found it lasted the day without a fuss during my tests.\n\nWhat I found the most concerning about 4G were the weird network oddities I witnessed. On a number of occasions, I\u2019d walk a few steps and immediately drop from a steady 13Mbps connection to less than 1Mbps, or the phone would tell me I had a strong 4G signal but I\u2019d have no network connectivity at all. I had to toggle airplane mode more than a few times during my tests just to get connectivity back, and it reminded me of the early days of both 3G when modems and their associated networks weren\u2019t well optimized. But a simple software update on my phone seemed to clear these issues. Owners of the latest iPhone models will have to upgrade to the latest iOS 13.4 to avoid dropped calls.\n\nEarly signs of promise\n\nIt does highlight the early nature of Lycamobile Uganda\u2019s 5G, though. The company has implemented this new connectivity using the 800 MHz band in towns and rural areas, which, in my experience, have been great for more coverage, but they don\u2019t have all the benefits that 4G promises of 100 Mbps speeds. Higher frequencies above 1800 MHz allow for much more bandwidth (speeds) to be passed to 5G devices, but they operate over a smaller distance, and the radio waves can\u2019t easily penetrate walls and objects that are in between you and the 4G antenna. The first 5G networks in Uganda are also using 800 MHz on the lower bands and 2,600 Hz on the higher side.\n\nEventually, 4G in Uganda and elsewhere will move toward the higher band spectrum. This promises far better speeds than I\u2019ve seen during my tests, but the challenges of shorter transmission ranges will be even more difficult when there\u2019s interference from walls, buildings, or even rain.\n\nThe real test of Lyacamobile Uganda\u2019s 4G network will be how well the operators will manage capacity and bandwidth requirements. We\u2019ve seen the previous promises of 3G speeds, only to see these choke at busy points in cities. 3G in Kampala is particularly bad in large parts of the city, and while 4G is certainly better, there are fewer people using this network right now.\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Your speeds may vary from the tests in our review. This can be attributed to many factors including; Location, the mobile device being used, and signal strength among others. We advise you to contact Lycamobile to be certain that you have good coverage at your place and the right device before you make the purchasing decision.", "link": "https://techjaja.com/a-week-with-lycamobile-ugandas-4g-lte-network-speed-coverage-and-more/", "published": "2020-04-29T08:12:05+00:00"}, {"title": "YoTV Vs Airtel TV app Review: Battle of mobile TV streaming in Uganda \u2013 Techjaja", "author": ["Roger Bambino", "The Love For Gadgets", "Technology Is Deeply Rooted In His Dna", "He Is A Blogger", "Really Obsessed With Cool Devices.

They are mobile phone apps that are centered on Live TV and radio programming \u2014 all usable on Android phones and iPhones. The two platforms (YoTV channels and Airtel TV) have been pushed by MTN and Airtel respectively each luring subscribers with key differentiators apart from the costs of the service. Speaking of cost, Airtel TV is free of charge while those who want to access YoTV channels using MTN network will have to part with as low as UGX 1,000 per day but you can use any other internet network of your choice.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo start, let me reiterate that your phone or tablet is the only way to experience both Airtel TV and YoTV. There is no original programming, which is a standout and a clear deal-breaker for some people I\u2019ve talked to who are used to watching content from the likes of Netflix or Quibi \u2014 especially right now when everyone is at home for so much of the day. You can\u2019t access these services on the web, and there\u2019s not even a tablet-optimized version of both apps. No Chromecast. No AirPlay. It\u2019s for your phone, nothing else.\n\nAt launch, both Airtel TV and YoTV delivered apps that are, in a word, fine. They work reliably, even if the user experience for some comes off as a little basic compared to Netflix and other streaming giants. When you rotate your device, none of these apps will automatically flip between landscape and portrait presentation modes while showing the full screen, and both orientations were never factored into the creative process. But truth be told we should leave portrait mode viewing for social media apps and not entertainment apps, although we have seen the likes of Quibi having both modes. It should be noted that the dual-stream approach uses more data (around 20 percent) than your typical YouTube or Netflix video stream. So I guess it was a wise idea for both apps to have only one mode.\n\nBelow is detailed table on how both YoTV and Airtel TV compare apps compare;\n\nYoTV Airtel TV Mobile Operating system Android & iOS Android & iOS Channels Local TV and Radio Trace TV, Al Jazeera, Nautical, Bloomberg, GodTV, Gametoon, Fashion Box and Inspiration TV among others. Bollywood, Ugawood and Nollywood movie channels Network support All networks Only Airtel network Original Programming No No Free Trial 1 month (on MTN network) 1 month VPN friendly Yes No Chromecast an AirtPlay Support No No WebApp support No No Optimized for Tablet Yes Yes LiveTV programming Yes Yes Taking Screenshots Yes No Pricing 1 hour \u2013 UGX 500\n\nI day \u2013 UGX 1,000\n\nI month \u2013 UGX 10,000 Free (data bundle charges apply)\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn my testing, both apps worked well even with cellular connection but don\u2019t expect Airtel TV to work on any other network apart from Airtel. Some users have complained of buffering but that all depends on the quality of your network.\n\nNeither YoTV nor Airtel TV offers the options for bandwidth management. This would be good to help people manage their data by allowing users set streaming quality to auto or data saver mode.\n\nSince these are TV services don\u2019t expect any Original TV programming as the telcos treat these apps as value-added services through IPTV (TV over the internet) integration and not a major product managed by them in-house.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBoth apps stumble hard on a lot of other basics, and they were launched with significant omissions. For example, currently, there\u2019s no option to set up profiles for the other people in your family on a single account, especially for Airtel TV. The app is limited to a single concurrent TV stream, so account or password sharing is out altogether.\n\nPut the content aside, and part of your enjoyment from Airtel TV or YoTV will always depend on how nice your phone is \u2014 and how large of a display it has. Testing the TV streaming apps on an iPhone 11 Pro Max, a Huawei Mate 30 Pro and Galaxy S20 Ultra has been wonderful, but I\u2019m someone who can comfortably wield those mammoth phones. If you\u2019re not, you might find yourself a little disappointed that the TV apps are forever limited to the screen dimensions of your iPhone X or another device for normal-sized hands. This is a constraint that no other major streaming service forces us to contend with. You can always open Netflix or even Instagram on your computer to up the sense of immersion.\n\nHave you used Airtel TV or MTN\u2019s YoTV app? What do you like or hate about each?

At the beginning of last year, they launched the itel A16, an affordable entry-level device that ships with Andriod Go. This year, the company is back with itel A56, a larger 6.0-inch screen budget phone. Will this phone help set a new bar for low budget phones, or get lost in a sea of mediocrity? Find out in Techjaja\u2018s Google review later in the week.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWe managed to receive a copy of the trademark \u201cBigger is Better\u201d smartphone and its simple elegant packaging tempted us to surely unbox as to have a glimpse of what comes along with the Itel A56 for now.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nPrecious little: itel A56 phone, a USB cable, a charger head, red earphones, and a transparent phone case. The box is pretty much the standard itel mobile phone box if you care about that sort of thing.\n\nitel A56 out of the box components.\n\nDesign\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nStarting with the front, the large 6.0-inch display is flanked by not-too-large bezels on the sides. Yes, there\u2019s a bit of a chin at the bottom and the top which houses the 5-megapixel front selfie camera with the flashlight. The IPS LCD fullscreen in use here isn\u2019t bad at all. I took it out and about and, for the most part, I didn\u2019t have any issues with viewing it outdoors.\n\nitel A56 6.0 Inch Display\n\nThe dual rear camera setup is also is vertically arranged, along with a rear placed fingerprint scanner. The rear camera is 8 MP and houses a LED Flash. The Fingerprint accommodates accelerometer, gyro, proximity and compass functionality.\n\nStay Updated\n\nDesign is one of the most important factors when it comes to mobiles. This phone is 159.7 x 77.7 x 8.9 mm slim and the weight is 164 g which runs on Android 9.0 (Pie, Go Edition) operating system.\n\nitel A56 Rear Cameras\n\nHeadphone jacks are still common on entry-level hardware and, yes, the itel A56 has one as well on the top part of the phone.\n\nThe Positives (What we like so far)\n\nThe Battery: The itel A56 is equipped with a cool 4000 mAh battery capacity to keep it running throughout the day and even more if you are a battery saver. The phone caters to users who are often on the road, make a lot of phone calls, and generally push batteries to their limits.\n\nThe performance: The itel A56 performance stands out from the usual entry-level smartphones for me. The Andriod Go edition software is well mated to the hardware and this makes it surprisingly fast and easy to use. The 1GB RAM isn\u2019t enough for gaming though if you plan to play heavy-duty games like PUBG on the device then I advise you to reconsider your decision. However, if you stick with the simpler 2D games(Candy Crush ish), your experience will be remarkably fine.\n\nitel A56 Performance\n\nSecurity: The A56 has a fingerprint sensor at the back for out of the box security. There is also a face unlock feature which the company claims are so secure in that when you don\u2019t blink, your phone can\u2019t unlock. ( I\u2019m yet to try that)\n\nThe Negatives (What we don\u2019t like)\n\nThe itel A56 does not support 4G technology. It\u2019s pretty much what we don\u2019t like out of the box now that telecoms are pushing for 4G technology and the demand for a 4G enabled phone is more like a necessity.\n\nThere is another edition of the same phone(itel A56 Pro) which supports 4G technology and have superior specs to this particular one. We will keep you posted in case itel Mobile decides to launch it here in Uganda.\n\nItel A56 Specifications\n\nDisplay 6.0\u2033 960 x 480 IPS Processor Unisoc SC7731E 1.3Ghz quad-core CPU RAM 1GB Storage 16GB internal\n\nSD card up to 32GB Selfie Camera 5MP with flash Rear cameras 8MP main camera + VGA camera Battery size 4000mAh OS Android Pie Go edition Network support 2G and 3G at 900/1800mhz Other features Face unlock and Fingerprint scanner Colours Gradation Blue, Black\n\nItel A56 Price and Availability in Uganda\n\nYou can get one at itel branded shops and Airtel service centres across the country. Customers can also utilize the partnership that the manufacturers have with Airtel Uganda and enjoy 100% data bonus whenever they load data for the next 3 months.

The Camon 12 has seen a big push not only from TECNO itself but MTN Uganda too and we can only hope the reception has been nothing but good. The two partnered to deliver the phone bundled with giveaways with the most interesting one being data.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo some, the Camon 12 will look familiar as it shares somewhat a lot of similarities with other phones that have launched from the TECNO stable recently. With it comes features we have seen TECNO front like the Tripple AI camera that brings across wide-angle and macro-photography, the waterdrop notch, the chin bezel among others.\n\nHowever, the Camon 12 stands out in its own right and gives us what we have always expected from the Camon series, decent photography especially selfies at a pretty affordable price of UGX 569,000 for the model that we were able to review.\n\n\n\nBuild & Design\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAs said earlier, the Camon 12 shares an almost similar design language with other TECNO phones we reviewed earlier like the Phantom 9, but this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re similar in every aspect as we never came across an in-display fingerprint scanner, the Camon\u2019s was found to be the good old back fingerprint scanner, no AMOLED display with the Camon shipping with a large 6.52\u2019 LCD display panel with a large footprint than its predecessor.\n\nThe build is mostly plastic with a unibody design that houses the volume rockers and power buttons on the right plus the two Nano-SIM card slots on the left as well as the vertically aligned triple AI cameras at the back. Not forgetting a micro-USB charging port at the bottom and speaker grills.\n\nStay Updated\n\nThe Camon 12 even with its large footprint felt light in the hands but you might need more than one hand to use it.\n\nThe Software\n\nThe Camon 12 ships with Android 9.0 Pie with heavy skinning from TECNO\u2019s own HiOS operating system. Apart from the occasional intrusive HiOS ads, the software ran pretty smooth with no hiccups though be sure to expect an update the moment you boot up the phone.\n\nAs is the case, HiOS comes with a lot of customizations across fonts, themes and the like and the Camon 12 didn\u2019t miss out on the magic. It even has its own store from which you can download most of the aforementioned items.\n\n\n\nThe AI Camera(s)\n\nYes, the Camera! The Camon 12 has a rear Tripple AI camera of 16MP + 2MP + 8MP. The 16MP for AI-based photography and HDR, 8MP for 120\u00b0 wide-angle shots and 2cm micro photography shots and the 2MP camera brings in the AI bokeh effect. The main selfie shooter is 16MP as well but generally, I preferred it to the rear shooter. Photos from both cameras were decent, to say the least, the selfies were particularly brighter but the cameras struggled with night photography, dim-lit indoor shots, and video.\n\nThe camera interface is infused with AI-powered features like Google Lens, AR Stickers emojis. The Camera also doubled as a phone unlocker with the face unlock embedded features which worked pretty fine.\n\nPlus Performance\n\nThe Camon 12 is powered by a MediaTek Helio P22 paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It held up against most tasks thrown at it and performed particularly well in day-to-day phone activities that include a tremendous amount of notifications, browsing, emails, social networking, calls, light gaming among others.\n\n\n\nBattery\n\nIt boasts of a 4000mAh battery, strong enough to withstand the aforementioned activities for a day without charge. And on days with less activity, the Camon 12 could extend its battery juice into a second day before the red sign of danger could show up. Overall, the battery is good!\n\n\n\nNetwork\n\n4G is here and a host of other network configurations that extend all the way to the good old 2G. So expect faster download speeds across the board and in instances where 4G reception is dismal, 3G speeds can right away kick in. Much as TECNO partnered with MTN to launch the Camon 12, our review model worked fine across other networks like Airtel but be sure the dual SIM card option can always sort you out.\n\n\n\nWhere To Buy From\n\nTECNO\u2019s partnership with MTN affords the Camon 12 to be found in most MTN outlets across the country bundled with giveaways like data but also at TECNO\u2019s own retail footprint spread across the country at a recommended retail price of UGX 569,000.\n\n", "link": "https://techjaja.com/the-tecno-camon-12-review-ai-everything-camera/", "published": "2019-12-02T05:57:30+00:00"}, {"title": "UCC requests all radio stations to submit fresh license applications \u2013 Techjaja", "author": ["Victor Tinka", "Exploring Computer Vulnerabilities Is My Passion But I Always Find My Hands Dirty With Code.

Therefore, reading notes and handouts alone did not make much sense to Namuli as she needed to refer to the referenced material which she did not have.\n\n\u201cBack at campus, I would easily download this material from the library or anywhere around the University with WiFi,\u201d says Namuli \u201cSo I asked my parents to buy me data bundles.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAlthough the bundles were availed, Namuli knows that they were costly especially at such a time when her mother\u2019s business remains closed due to the Covi19 prevention guidelines.\n\nLike Namuli, Lynn Kwikiriza, a third-year Law student at Uganda Christian University admitted to the biting cost of data while studying at home; \u201cI was used to opting for the library Wi-Fi while at the campus. Mobile data while at home is quite costly given these hard times.\u201d\n\nStay Updated\n\nIn different phone interviews with some university students, they all express the high cost of accessing learning material online. However, telecom companies like MTN closed that gap by zero-rating university e-learning sites, just like it did for the Primary and secondary school learners.\n\nStudents from universities including Makerere, Uganda Christian University, Uganda Martyrs, Kyambogo, International University of East Africa, Mbarara, and Gulu are benefitting from this offer. By zero-rating the e-learning platforms, lecturers can upload study materials to the platforms at no data cost to enable students to study for free while at home.\n\n\u201cOh my God, It\u2019s the best offer ever. You know how we lawyers read widely and heavily. I am sorted,\u201d Kwikiriza said hysterically. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing and very convenient. I can see their results and course work marks at any time without data worries.\u201d\n\nThis offer has seen many learners get out of their comfort zones and study despite the pandemic and lockdown.\n\nAccording to Trevor Ochom, a final year student of Education at Kyambogo University this offer is an answered prayer.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done, I know we shall have quite a marathon back at university once schools reopen. So the best way to keep up is by reading ahead while at home,\u201d says Ochom, noting that this offer makes studying while at home very easy. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need a laptop, a simple smartphone is enough. I appeal to fellow students to use their time at home productively.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kwikiriza, the content on the website is insightful and students have no excuse whatsoever when it comes to studying: \u201dI would totally recommend it to my course mates and friends seeing as we need all the information we can get at the moment.\u201d\n\nMakerere University Vice-Chancellor Prof Barnabas Nawangwe has lauded the telecommunications giant for this gesture saying it will go a long way in enabling students to catch up on lost study time as they will now have access to the study materials at no cost.\n\n\u201cOur negotiations with MTN Uganda yielded a lot of fruit as the telecom company has accepted to zero-rate six of our (Makerere University) online learning platforms.

He looks forward to leading the Finance division and contributing to MTN Uganda\u2019s future success as the country embarks on this thrilling Digital journey that the telecom is committed to deliver.\n\nMr. Bugembe brings to his position, more than 21 Years of Telecom experience from various countries, working at MTN in different capacities, holding executive and senior management roles in finance departments, including holding the CFO position at MTN Liberia and MTN Congo Brazzaville.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nMr. Bugembe\u2019s robust career at MTN has seen him serve in five different countries. Some of the key highlights of his career at MTN include concluding a $300m syndicated medium term facility, in a Project Finance deal that won an award for the best telecoms deal in Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) in 2012.\n\nAlthough he takes over office at a difficult time when many company revenues are getting slashed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the seasoned accountant is no stranger to operating amidst disasters like this one.\n\nStay Updated\n\nHe spent a lot of time resizing the cost structures for a couple of MTN OPCOs to align with changing macro-economic trends especially during the Ebola crisis in West Africa and the drop in oil prices while in Central Africa.\n\nAs CFO of the country\u2019s highest tax payer, Mr Bugembe\u2019s key roles will be to drive the company profitability mandate, to ensure effective and efficient Capital allocation, and to support Service revenue growth through data analytics with focus on non-voice revenues. He will also support key transformation initiatives, build internal capacity, support digitization with focus on FinTech in addition to continuous cost optimization and improving working capital management among others.\n\nccording to Mr Bugembe, there\u2019s still opportunity for telecoms in Uganda, given that the mobile penetration is barely over 51%. The data penetration is still low driven mainly by lower smart phone penetration, customer education and relevant digital content. This will be key for future growth of telecom in Uganda. He also notes that Uganda\u2019s youthful market coupled with the many SMEs, steady GDP growth and low inflation is a great opportunity for any business.\n\nWith the telecom trends indicating the customers\u2019 needs are changing towards data, Fintech (Mobile Money) and digital, Mr Bugembe believe these will drive the future of telecoms especially in Uganda with emphasis on financial inclusion as the country moves towards a cashless economy.\n\nIn addition to the 21 years of telecom experience, Mr Bugembe is a chartered accountant (FCCA-UK) with a Masters degree from University of Wollongong in Australia and he hold a Bachelors of Commerce Degree from India.\n\nMr Bugembe describes himself as a passionate, curious and adaptive person, having lived, studied and worked in seven countries. He enjoys travelling to different countries to explore various cultures and have time to himself and his family away from work. He is married with two amazing sons aged 11 and 8 years.

It\u2019s made our lives easier and opened opportunities for earning a living, connecting with people across the globe, and more. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also drawn the attention of unsocial elements in society which is why there are all kinds of online frauds that we face today. The following are some of them that you need to know:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n1. Phishing Emails\n\nPhishing is one of the most common online frauds that we know of and it\u2019s also one of the online scams you should avoid in lockdown. In this, a scamster tries to trick an email user into believing that they, the scamster, is actually a representative of a bank or a government office. They usually send an email to create a panic situation. For instance, you may receive an email from a particular bank and the message may say that your online bank account has been compromised and you have to change your password to secure it immediately. If you click the link shared in the email, then it may take you to a fake website that looks identical to the bank\u2019s original website. Once you share your current password with this website, then it\u2019s shared with the scamster and they can use it to transfer your money to their account.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nPhishing attacks are rampant. However, if you are careful and check the authenticity of suspicious emails before you take action, then you can prevent becoming a victim in most cases.\n\n2. Ransomware\n\nStay Updated\n\nRansomware programs are an advanced family of viruses that when active, can gain administrative rights to your computer system and lock you out. You usually get a warning from the attacker that if you have important files and documents on the device and you want to access them again, then you have to pay a ransom to the attack.\n\nRansomware are quite dangerous. You can prevent them from infecting your computer by using the best antivirus for Windows, downloading software from trusted sites only, and avoiding downloading attachments that are sent in suspicious emails.\n\n3. Fake Shopping Websites\n\nWe all love shopping online. It\u2019s convenient, offers great discounts, and you get to choose from a wide range of products from the comfort of your home. However, if you aren\u2019t careful, then you can fall for a fake shopping website scam.\n\nThere are thousands of online shopping websites. However, not all of them can be trusted. There are many websites that look legitimate, but they may steal your banking information or accept your payment and not deliver the products. The good news is that you can easily identify them if you are using Internet security solutions from trusted brands like Bitdefender. These companies offer Internet security software that can block malicious shopping websites for your protection.\n\n4. Job Offer Scam\n\nFraud entities have not spared even the employment domain. These people send emails with lucrative job opportunities that are fake. The messages typically start with claims that the recruiter saw your resume on LinkedIn or some other job portal and you are selected for a particular job profile. They mention that you can expect to earn a monthly salary of a particular amount which is quite high. The job is in a different country and you are required to pay a certain amount as a fee for legal work. That\u2019s the trap. If you pay this amount for the seeming dream job that\u2019s offered, then you will never see it. So, make sure that you verify the details of such emails and also do some background checking before you take any step. A rule of thumb is- if a job is offered which is too good to be true, then it probably is.\n\nYour Safety is in Your Hands\n\nThe Internet is a wonderful place, but it\u2019s also a scary place. If you are not careful, then you can easily become a victim or a fraud or even identity theft. So, make sure you stay up to date with the emerging risks on the Internet. Also, set up comprehensive online security programs on all your devices- mobiles and computers, as soon as possible. If you are looking for a recommendation, then Bitdefender is a good one. They are even running a 90-day free trial currently.

It\u2019s hard not to admit that this innovation will appeal to a large number of users, because many are simply tired of all these cutouts, notches and holes. And the introduction of this technology is now one step closer to reality due to the Chinese company Visionox. Huawei and Xiaomi are using the displays of this manufacturer. By the way, the flexible display of the Mi Mix Alpha is from Visionox.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nToday, the Chinese display manufacturer has announced a new technology. In fact, this is a method of manufacturing an OLED panel, which allows you to achieve the required level of transparency in the area where the front camera will be located. After all, as you know, it is precisely the inability to offer a sufficient level of transparency of the display is the key problem in the implementation of sub-screen selfie cameras.\n\nVisionox has succeeded to manufacture OLED panels with a high level of transparency that allows to take high-quality photos. Together with other companies, they also have been working on algorithms that allow you to avoid the \u201cfogging\u201d effect.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBut most importantly, Visionox is ready to start mass production of such innovative OLED panels. And if so, then the first smartphones with a sub-screen camera may appear this year. OnePlus product manager also spoke in favor of this development. He said that already in the second half of this year, the technology of the sub-screen camera will enter mass production and will be embodied in commercial products.\n\nHuawei\u2019s under screen camera patents\n\nStay Updated\n\nRecently, a report shows that Huawei seems to be working on a smartphone of this kind. This device comes with a highly rounded display and an under-screen camera. This is evident from two patent applications which now have CNIPA approval.\n\nThe publication date of both patents is June 2, 2020 and each includes 7 product images of an unannounced Huawei smartphone. Basically, the two patents are alike \u2013 only the rear camera system differs by model.\n\nThis smartphone is a very futuristic-looking device. The product images show a full-screen Huawei phone. The screen extends very far to the sides \u2013 further than the current waterfall display on the Mate 30 series. There are also no physical buttons on the sides of the device. For the volume keys, Huawei has long used the principle that these can be called up virtually via the sidebar.

In a year when containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern and a fever can be an early indicator of infection.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe first of these Huawei smartphones is the Honor Play 4 Pro. Smartphones have always been the modern tech equivalent of a multi-purpose Army knife, combining a phone, a music player, a camera, a GPS, a PDA, and more into a single device. Now Huawei is pitching yet another device that can be integrated into a smartphone: a thermometer.\n\nIn a long detailed video posted on the Chinese social media site Weibo, Huawei shows off how the feature will work. It works like standard commercial temperature guns, a user just needs to aim at the phone at someone\u2019s forehead, tap through the app, and the phone will give you a temperature reading. Temperature checks aren\u2019t a guaranteed way to screen for COVID-19, but a fever is a symptom in the majority of hospitalized cases, and it\u2019s very easy to check for.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe smartphone thermometer uses infrared technology (the same used in your TV remote control) to work as a non-contact thermometer which is becoming a common sight world-over. Huawei says its IR sensor can read temperatures from -20\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C. It should be noted that an IR sensor isn\u2019t as accurate as a thermal camera, and neither device, which reads a surface temperature, is as accurate as an internally taken temperature.\n\nIR sensors are cheap, though, and they are already frequently integrated into a smartphone for face unlock and camera effects, or even as remote controls \u2013so Huawei was able to quickly react to the pandemic.\n\nStay Updated\n\nThe Huawei\u2019s \u201cHonor\u201d line is designed to bring a close to high-end features to a cheaper device.

In fact, many of those changes could be considered seismic, particularly in the area of live dealer casino which effectively created a new an entirely new arm of the casino industry. However, there is one trend in casino gaming that everyone is talking about right now, and its popularity sees no sign of slowing down \u2013 Megaways games.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nYou\u2019ll find Megaways games at the UK\u2019s best casinos online, but we will do our best to explain the phenomenon and why it has become so popular. Megaways games are online slots with a specific technology developed by Big Time Gaming. That technology sees a series of shifting reels during every spin, which can create anything from a few hundred combinations to over one hundred thousand different winning lines.\n\nTechnology licensed to rival developers\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBig Time Gaming created the concept of Megaways for some of its signature games, such as Bonanza and Extra Chilli, but so popular did it become that the casino software developer has now licensed the technology to other developers, most notably Blueprint Gaming. The upshot is that we now have dozens of Megaways games, and it has effectively created a new sub-genre of casino gaming.\n\nTo give you a flavour of what Megaways is all about, we will take a look at one of the most popular examples: Return of Kong Megaways. This game from Blueprint Gaming is, as you can guess by the title, loosely based on the classic Nintendo game Donkey Kong. It features 3D graphics and a handful of bonus features and special effects, but the game really comes alive during the Kong Feature. In it, you will win free spins with an unlimited multiplier, which can lead to massive wins of 1000s of times your stake.\n\nStay Updated\n\nAnother example is Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Megaways, which is based on the popular quiz show. This is officially licensed content, so you can expect all the imagery and sounds of the tv show, as well as WWTBAM-themed bonus games. As with Return of Kong, the game has massive payout potential, especially in the bonus game. Other popular Megaways games include Monopoly Megaways, Montezuma, Deal or No Deal Megaways and Rainbow Riches Megaways. As you can see, many of the games are based on elements of pop culture.\n\n<iframe width=\u201d560\u2033 height=\u201d315\u2033 src=\u201dhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/FqdSmKABB5A\u201d frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 allow=\u201daccelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\u201d allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nGames have huge payout potential\n\nWhile the games are all different, and many differ through their creative and exciting bonus games, they all share that potentially explosive payout potential. When you think about it, even if each winning combination is worth just a few cents, it is amplified tremendously by having (potentially) over 100,000 different winning combinations. That\u2019s the key to the games\u2019 popularity, as it effectively keeps players on the edge of their seats as they know that the next spin could be a life-changing one.\n\nA word of warning, though; while Megaways games have attracted players who aim to win big prizes, the games are classed as volatile. This means that they do not sustain players\u2019 balances with small wins in the same manner as non-volatile slots. In short, the games are designed to offer one \u2018big hit\u2019, but be warned that the payout might never arrive. As such, Megaways games should be treated like buying a lottery ticket, and you should only play with money you are happy to lose; there is no guarantee of winning, but there is always a chance that your number comes up.", "link": "https://techjaja.com/megaways-the-hottest-trend-in-online-casino-gaming/", "published": "2020-06-04T17:25:03+00:00"}, {"title": "Your next Windows 10 update will come with new Edge browser \u2013 Techjaja", "author": ["Techjaja Staff", "A Techjaja 'Bot' Profile"], "text": "We have been using Microsoft\u2019s new chromium-based Edge browser since it was launched in January, but at that time users had to specifically download it.

That\u2019s up far more than double from the same time last year when it made $122 million, and it comes in well above the $200 million that Zoom expected it would make when it issued guidance just a few months ago.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is still not clear, how exactly how many people used Zoom software over the past few months, but the company claims it added an \u201cunprecedented number of free participants,\u201d including more than 100,000 K-12 schools. The company now has around 265,400 customers with more than 10 employees, a number that\u2019s grown 354 percent, the company says, and it added 175,000 licenses for new customers. That significant increase in usage has come with a significant increase in costs, though \u2014 expenses doubled year over year to $201 million.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings report is it\u2019s first since the pandemic was declared, which offers a deeper look at how the company performed as its video chat software becomes the de facto tool for work meetings and staying in touch with family and friends while much of the world is stuck at home. Zoom previously said that usage has grown to 300 million meeting participants each day, up from just 10 million in December. That figure has since fallen from its peak in April. But certainly, over the long term, the company expects it to grow beyond that 300 million number.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNot all has been rosy for the video conferencing company, it has faced incredible scrutiny of its security practices. The company was heavily criticized for implying its video chats were fully encrypted when they were not. Features meant for convenience also enabled harassment through Zoom bombing, which recently happened to Airtel during a conferencing call.\n\nALSO READ: What is Zoombombing?\u2013 Here is how Zoom has solved it\n\nZoom tackles security\n\nStay Updated\n\nIn response, Zoom instituting a 90-day feature freeze while it overhauled the app\u2019s security practices. Features, like actual end-to-end encryption, are being worked on. In May, Zoom acquired the identity service startup Keybase and directed its engineers toward working on an end-to-end encryption solution.\n\nAll these changes are meant to ensure that, as its usage increases, such that Zoom doesn\u2019t lose users over security concerns. And so far, it seems like Zoom expects its success to continue. Zoom predicts a huge next quarter, more than tripling its previous revenue. The company expects to make upward of $1.8 billion in revenue over the course of the year. Zoom does, however, expect to see increased customer losses in the second half of the year simply because of how many new users it\u2019s picked up.", "link": "https://techjaja.com/the-rise-and-rise-of-zoom-during-the-pandemic/", "published": "2020-06-03T09:22:04+00:00"}, {"title": "Google\u2019s new Android TV streaming device leaks \u2013 Techjaja", "author": ["Techjaja Staff", "A Techjaja 'Bot' Profile"], "text": "Apart from announcing its latest Nexus devices, Google has also shown off a whole new completely redesigned $35 Chromecast dongle.

May be they have sensitive information that they would want the other party to see. There is no doubt that WhatsApp, Gmail, and the image gallery can all contain private content that you may want to keep to yourself. This is where Techjaja comes in \u2014 to show you how can protect sensitive information from prying eyes and still hand over your smartphone with app locks.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Secure Folder\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis with Samsung smartphones, you have an inbuilt solution\u2013 you can store apps, pictures, and other files in a Secure Folder. This is shielded from your main account by a separate code. You can\u2019t even access the data in the secure folder externally with a USB cable and a PC.\n\nUsing the Secure Folder does mean that you will need to completely setup WhatsApp or other apps again. Notifications are sent from the Secure Folder to your main profile. A luxurious settings menu makes it easy to set your desired privacy options. In return, you get protection at the system level, which makes it difficult even for resourceful spies.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nALSO READ: A list of the 10 most visited Ugandan websites in 2020\n\nHuawei\u2019s PrivateSpace\n\nThe Huawei EMUI user interface offers a similar feature to PriveSpace. In this case as well images, data and apps are isolated by the main user, but you don\u2019t need to retrieve apps to put them there. Instead, you can create a second user on your Huawei smartphone. To start the protected area, you simply use a different finger on the lock screen than you use for the main profile.\n\nUsing lock apps for Android Smartphones\n\nStay Updated\n\nThe Google Play Store or iOS App store are both packed with apps that can be used to block apps. The search term \u2018app lock\u2019 will deliver dozens of results. We chose an example that won\u2019t require too many permissions from you.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a warning: app lock apps aren\u2019t real protection against curious people if they\u2019re clever enough! They are often not even able to completely hide the last viewed content in an app; the most recent messages can be quickly seen before the code entry appears.\n\nUntil the Android interface and the App Locker work better together on your smartphone, you are better off switching to a method that comes with Android\u2019s factory software. These methods are presented above and others below.\n\nKeepsafe doesn\u2019t let you take screenshots on your smartphone, so we\u2019ll have to explain our observations with text. First of all, I like the fact that the app doesn\u2019t require any authorizations. The setup wizard asks for the type of lock: PIN, pattern, or fingerprint. You don\u2019t have to register a fingerprint again since the app uses the fingerprint already stored in your Android phone. This builds trust because it means the app can\u2019t send your fingerprint back to the app creators.\n\nYou need to provide your email address for security, but you can also skip this point. The app then sends you to the system settings, where you need to grant access to the data usage. Without it, the app can\u2019t tell if it has been opened. You can then return to App Lock, where you can select apps to lock. Popular apps like Settings or WhatsApp are listed on top, and the rest follow alphabetically.\n\nAndroid features for securing apps\n\nUnlike apps, Android\u2019s features work reliably. Unfortunately, they are not available to all smartphones. The following features were introduced with Android 5.0 Lollipop in 2014.\n\nScreen lock\n\nMaybe reverse logic is right for you: simply determine which app (singular!) other people may use. Thanks to the lock screen on Android 5.0 Lollipop, Android has mastered how this trick works. Simply pin the apps that can be opened without unlocking the screen.\n\nLocked apps can be opened by simultaneously pressing the back key and the multitasking key on your smartphone. Then Android will ask for the screen lock pattern if you\u2019ve set it that way. So in principle, all your apps are blocked, except the pinned ones.\n\nCreate a user or guest account\n\nIf the apps above aren\u2019t reliable enough for you, you should use the operating system\u2019s options. If the temporary user isn\u2019t meant to use your main profile, you can quickly create a guest account or a second user account on your smartphone. You can do this through a button located above the quick settings on the top.\n\nSimply create a new user. They will have their own account or no Google account at all. They\u2019ll only be allowed to install apps from the PlayStore, and can\u2019t make phone calls, send SMS messages, or access others\u2019 data. This of course also includes your apps. If you set it up as a user and not as a guest, you can even regularly pass the phone to another person, who can store their data on it too.", "link": "https://techjaja.com/the-best-ways-to-secure-individual-apps-on-your-smartphone/", "published": "2020-06-03T05:26:25+00:00"}]}, "BIG EYE": {"link": "https://bigeye.ug/", "articles": [{"title": "Sheila Gashumba mocks Fatboy after he loses his job", "author": [], "text": "By BigEyeUg Team\n\nKampala City socialite, fashionista, and brand influencer Sheila Gashumba is fond of exhibiting her ego without giving a damn about what anyone else on the other side feels.\n\nThe pencil-sized fashion lover who has been in disarray with different media houses for the past two months over her controversial Shs.50K paycheck revelation is up in arms with Radio Sanyu\u2019s FatBoy.\n\nThis is after she played a tit-for-tat with former 88.2 Sanyu FM presenter James Onen (FatBoy), who was fired from the station earlier this week.\n\nTaking it to her social handles, Sheila blew a strong horn of triumph for FatBoy\u2019s sacking as she asked him to recall when she stood up for those who were being used in the media with little pay and he made fun of it.\n\nSheila says it\u2019s unbelievable that FatBoy chose to strike over a 25% salary cut because of COVID-19 despite siding with the bosses\u2019 repeated unfair actions towards their employees over the years.\n\n\u201cSays FatBoy on 2nd May 2020 but decided to strike because of a 25% salary cut because of COVID-19 yet he was earning an 8figure amount!!! Lemme even stop here, Tomorrow I\u2019m waking up to listen to Patrick Salvado Idringi on 88.2 Sanyu FM,\u201d wrote Sheila.\n\nSheila Gashumba and FatBoy\n\nIn FatBoy\u2019s statement dated 2nd May 2020 that has been resurrected by Sheila, he condemned her reasoning over the media houses\u2019 alleged Shs. 50K paycheck and advised her to focus on building her brand before she would task bosses for a pay increase.\n\n\u201cSo, if a TV station offers you 50K for your first gig, take the money and build your brand. Eventually they will have t increase your money or better opportunities will come your way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheila Gashumba is promoting a dangerous entitlement mentality that has afflicted a lot of millennials, unfortunately.

Its dangerous to give young people the impression that they deserve millions from the start of their careers because mbu thet \u201cdeserve more\u201d. If they have that mentality, they will never even get one foot in the door. Many successful people started by earning absolutely nothing. Then you build a name over time and take it from there.

More here.\n\nBy Our Reporter\n\n\u201cWhen Universities closed in March, I thought it would be for a short time so I decided to take a break from studies and relax a bit,\u201d says Doreen Namuli, a second year student of Economics at Makerere University. \u201cBut when the first three weeks ended, I started feeling rusty and I knew I had to read in order not to lose grips on what I had learnt and hopefully, use this time to read ahead.\u201d\n\nIt goes without saying that most university courses are research based and average students typically spend more time in the library as than in the lecture rooms. Therefore, reading notes and handouts alone did not make much sense to Namuli as she needed to refer to the referenced material which she did not have.\n\n\u201cBack at campus, I would easily download this material from the library or anywhere around the University with WiFi,\u201d says Namuli \u201cSo I asked my parents to buy me data bundles.\u201d\n\nAlthough the bundles were availed, Namuli knows that they were costly especially at such a time when her mother\u2019s business remains closed due to the COVID-19 prevention guidelines.\n\nLike Namuli, Lynn Kwikiriza, a third year Law student at Uganda Christian University admitted to the biting cost of data while studying at home; \u201cI was used to opting for the library Wi-Fi while at campus. Mobile data while at home is quite costly given these hard times.\u201d\n\nIn different phone interviews with some university students, they all expresses the high cost of accessing learning material online. However, MTN closed that gap by zero rating university elearning sites, just like it did for the Primary and secondary school learners.\n\nStudents from universities including Makerere, Uganda Christian University, Uganda Martyrs, Kyambogo, International University of East Africa, Mbarara and Gulu are benefitting from this offer. By zero rating the elearning platforms, lecturers can upload study materials to the platforms at no data cost to enable students study for free while at home.\n\n\u201cOh my God, It\u2019s the best offer ever.

It is behind some of the most popular TV series, and national talent competitions. Within a span of less than 10 years, they have produced many binge worthy TV shows like the crazy \u2018ERIC\u2019S GAME\u2019 dating show and NORTHERN CONNECT both on NTVU, ENSITAANO, a TV game trivia show on Bukedde TV, NBS TV\u2019s \u2018GIRL TALK\u2019 \u2013 a chit chat dialogue of beautiful campus girls, SMART KIDS and other shows like SUPERWORMAN, the UGANDA NATIONAL SPELLING BEE, \u201cMTN\u2019s Gaggawala\u201d with 100million to give away, VUVUZELA NATIONAL SPORTS CHALLENGE, a sports quiz show where sports fans do push-ups while answering sports questions\u2026 and the list goes on.\n\nThey have TV shows running across the East African Region in Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania on major TV stations like Citizen TV Kenya, TV10 Rwanda etc. Ugandans can now be very proud to know that the biggest TV production house in East Africa right now, is Ugandan, and is run by its founder a one Lubwama Eric Michael.\n\nWith editing suites located in Kyanja and large production warehouse in Nakawa, KUNTA PRODUCTIONS is a full service production company, with start to finish, High Definition video production. They have created thousands of motion pictures for not only TV stations, but for many corporate companies, non-profit organizations and advertisers. This is an achievement for the fast growing media, TV and film industry in Uganda.\n\nWhat is unique about KUNTA PRODUCTIONS\u2019 work is that they are clearly very creative, and professional. Their level of quality has only been imported in Uganda just a few years back. With such creative Ugandan minds and works, this gives a lot of hope that the East African film industry is growing very fast in comparison to other African regions. The Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) encouraged Ugandan TV stations to air at least 70% of locally made content. Inspiring the growth of companies such as KUNTA PRODUCTIONS working hand in hand with our ever growing number of TV stations, we are more certain about the quality of TV content on our local TV stations.

To survive this disastrous crisis that initially threatened to leave many businesses shutdown, business owners have taken on new models to adapt to the unprecedented situation.\n\nA case in point are the businesses that were previously not online but have now acquired an online presence in order to reach and serve their clients. This has seen more businesses become cloud enabled, offer flexibility to their workforces as well as adopt digital systems to support their work.\n\nIn a Webinar that was held recently, Dennis Musinguzi the Senior Manager, products and services at MTN Uganda says that although businesses suffered a lot at the beginning of the Covid19 lockdown, they have ensured their continuity by going digital and serving their customers through digital channels.\n\nMTN\u2019s Primera Muthoni who moderated the webinar last week.\n\n\u201cFresh food markets suffered the most during lockdown. However, they went digital and started doing home deliveries. They are now in business,\u201d Musinguzi said.\n\nChristopher Ssali, the Acting General Manager Mobile Financial Services at MTN Liberia noted that there has been an observed change in the payment habits over the last months as people are opting for contactless payment options more than before.\n\n\u201cCovid19 brings a new opportunity; previously more people felt more secure with cash. But after the pandemic, more people feel secure with payment options such as Mobile Money,\u201d Ssali said, noting that Mobile Money is a new safer currency for payment of both goods and services and more people are appreciating Mobile Money as a new currency.\n\nSsali further noted that the paradigm shift in the forms of payment has led to a Mobile Money evolution and as such, significantly reduce the need to use cash in the Value chain.\n\nIn resonance with Ssali, Stone Atwine, the Chief Executive Officer of Eversend noted that the increase in mobile money usage has kept businesses afloat by enabling them to transact during the pandemic. Borrowing credence from his company, Atwine said that companies should embrace new operational models in order to survive the adverse effects of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to do things that have not been done yet. For instance we are now doing cross boarder ecommerce, changing our product designs to include items such as donations and causes to help people raise funds for specific causes especially during these hard times,\u201d Atwine said.\n\n\n\n//////////ends////////\n\n", "link": "https://bigeye.ug/mtn-discusses-the-new-and-emerging-business-models-amidst-covid19/", "published": "2020-06-08T07:11:19+00:00"}, {"title": "Top 5 Ugandan Lockdown concerts that we enjoyed", "author": [], "text": "By Staff Writer\n\nThe year 2020 started off like any other. All was fine until COVID19 happened. Following the new reality of living with Corona in Uganda and the world at large, many people and brands have shifted their focus online to be able to stay in touch with friends and customers even when under lockdown.\n\nIn Uganda, brands and individual artistes have not been left out. Many have hopped onto the online frenzy to entertain. Some have really done a good job and this is why we are sharing with you, our top 5 lockdown concerts that we have enjoyed.\n\nBobi Wine live concert\n\nSinger and Politician Bobi Wine broke the record for online concerts in Uganda when he staged his free online concert in May. The well thought out and presented performance saw over 20,000 live viewers from around the world enjoying the music and the feeling of togetherness even under lockdown. Bobi\u2019s concert has close to 800,000 views as of today.\n\nClub Beats at Home\n\nClub beer started this with their Club Beats At Home concerts. Seasons 1 and 2 were epic. On season one premiere they managed to get 50,000 views for the concert which number has grown now since customers of the beer brand can replay and watch even after the live show. With artistes like Fik Fameica, Lillian Mbabazi, Ykee Benda, Chameleone, Naava Grey, King Saha, Irene Ntale, Lydia Jazmine, Cindy Sanyu and many more, Club gave customers the best entertainment using music while they were in lockdown. We have it on good authority that some guys used to tune in just to see the show host Martha Kay do her thing.\n\nTalent Africa Group\n\nSo, Talent Africa group, led by CEO Aly Alibhai set up a multi-million studio at their offices in Kololo. It seems like they saw this whole pandemic coming from a distance and decided to invest in a studio and use it to entertain their fans and customers while in lockdown. Through Tag TV, they have managed to bring entertainment using the internet to Ugandans who are locked up in their houses. Top musicians have graced the show including those from outside Uganda all because of the power of the internet. Their online concerts are surely a force to reckon with.\n\nDoctor Jose Chameleone concert\n\nThe music doctor and Kampala mayoral hopeful for 2021, Jose Chameleone didn\u2019t leave his fans our when it came to entertaining them in lockdown. On his 41st birthday, Chameleone staged a show on YouTube full with back up singers, instruments and great lighting. He managed to amass a great audience who tuned in to celebrate with him and also enjoy the awesome songs that he had lined up for them. Well done Chameleone.\n\nSpice Diana concert\n\nIf there is any lady in the Ugandan music industry who sets her goals way up high and goes ahead to achieve them, it is the Spice Diana. During the lockdown, she appeared on many live concerts. However, she later decided to do her own and boy oh boy did she sing. Spice was overwhelmed by the love from her fans who commented, sent out dancing emojis, and thanked her for entertaining them during the lockdown. We know you loved her show too.\n\nNotable mention. Mbarara\u2019s TPaul also set up a great concert online last weekend. Although it was supposed to happen at 7, he went live late in the night but it was worth the wait for her fans. From the set to the voices to the instruments, he really gave it his all just to connect with his fans.", "link": "https://bigeye.ug/top-5-ugandan-lockdown-concerts-that-we-enjoyed/", "published": "2020-06-07T10:07:04+00:00"}, {"title": "Top 7 Ugandan celebs with very talented kids", "author": [], "text": "By Staff Writer\n\nUgandan celebs especially the musicians are very talented. For many of them, it runs in the family and these top 7 are very talented kids just like their parents. Join us as we look at the top 7 Ugandan celebs with super-talented kids.\n\nFresh Daddy\u2019s son Fresh kid (Musician)\n\nThey say, like Father like son, but for Fresh Daddy real names Mutabazi Paul, it had to take his son Fresh Kid real name Patrick Sennyonjo\u2019s take over of the music industry for him to realise his talent. Shortly after Fresh Kid became the name on everyone\u2019s lips thanks to his talented rapping skills, his father joined the music industry. That said, it is clear that Fresh Daddy has a super talented kid in the 8-year-old Fresh kid and that is something to celebrate.\n\nBebe Cool and Zuena\u2019s son Alpha Thierry \u2013 Footballer\n\nOne wonders if at one time Bebe Cool looked at his son Alpha Thierry Ssali and hoped that he would join music like him. Alpha chose a different path and he is good at what he does. The youngster chose to develop his talent in sport, football to be exact and clearly he is in the right field. Alpha has made big football appearances in the likes of the Gothia cup/tournament in China. He is super talented.\n\nJose Chameleone and Daniela\u2019s son Abba Marcus Mayanja \u2013 Swimmer\n\nThe Mayanja family is blessed with so much talent. And like with Bebe Cool, Chameleone\u2019s son Abba Marcus Mayanja chose to divert from music and get into swimming. The boy\u2019s trophy cabinet is full of trophies that he has received for his participation in swimming from way back when he was so little. Abba who will soon be celebrating his 16th birthday recently matched the 1989 swimming record in USA. Way to go super talented Abba.\n\nBebe Cool\u2019s son Allan Hendrick Ssali \u2013 Musician\n\nBebe Cool appears on this list again because he is not only always busy making music in the studio, but he is also busy and serious when it comes to expanding his family. His son Allan Hendrick Ssali is not only the spitting image of his father but he is also a musician just like dad. With hits like Omukwano Gwo and Ononya under his belt, Hendrick who recently changed his stage name to Papper Daddy is a force to reckon within the industry. And with daddy\u2019s support, the sky is only the limit.\n\nIryn Namubiru\u2019s son Eko \u2013 Academician.\n\nSongstress Iryn Namubiru has been in the industry for quite some time. And if there is anything she has learned; it is that she has to give her children the best education so that they can be greater in future. Her son Eko Nyanzi Emile Morel is an academician something many people consider talent especially when you are always excelling. A year ago, he graduated high school with awesome grades and was admitted at University De Bourgogne to study Sociology in France. Tell me a better way to change the world than using your brain! Way to go Eko\n\nBetty Nakibuuka daughter Baby Gloria (Musician)\n\nGloria Mulungi Senyonjo aka Baby Gloria is a one of a kind child. She must be the envy of many parents after she joined music at the age of 3 years rocking fellow kids with awesome music. She has managed to make 4 music albums, has a charity organization in her name, has done commercials for different brands and she graduated high school in October last year. Surely if that is not talent, we don\u2019t know what is.\n\nJulie Mutesasira\u2019s Esther and Ezekiel\n\nThese ones need no introduction. Their talent was visible to the whole of East Africa and the world at last year\u2019s East Africa has got talent competition. The two who represented Uganda emerged top from the competition bagging close to 200 million Uganda shillings. Esther and Ezekiel\u2019s angelic voices are not a surprise as their mother is also a known musician.", "link": "https://bigeye.ug/top-7-ugandan-celebs-with-very-talented-kids/", "published": "2020-06-04T13:08:27+00:00"}, {"title": "Producer Zuli Tums Revives His Music Career With Terrific Melodies In New Song \u2018Tabu\u2019, Watch Video Here", "author": [], "text": "By BigEyeUg Team; Ugandan music producer, Zuli Tums popularly known for being behind songs such as Boom Party by Cindy Sanyu and Anjagala by Maro has found his way back into singing after a couple of years.\n\nThe CEO Master Beats, shut doors of becoming an artist years back and instead switched to music production and writing, where he has undoubtedly succeeded.\n\nHowever, as the English saying goes \u201cEast or west, home is best,\u201d Zuli has had sleepless nights of holding-back his inner beast in vocals which has prompted him to give it another try.\n\nZuli Tums\n\nAs of today, Zuli\u2019s music career has been reawakened with a signature under new music label, Blacq Avay Records, recording a new song dubbed \u2018Tabu\u2019.\n\n\u2018Tabu\u2019 is a slow dancehall love song that you would never fail to dance to or even dedicate to your loved ones.\n\nWatch Tabu by Zuli Tums here:\n\nWe wish you all the best Zuli!", "link": "https://bigeye.ug/producer-zuli-tums-revives-his-music-career-with-terrific-melodies-in-new-song-tabu-watch-video-here/", "published": "2020-06-01T18:49:00+00:00"}, {"title": "Eddy Kenzo, John Blaq Stun The 2020 HiPipo Music Awards, See Full List of Winners", "author": [], "text": "By BigEyeUg Team; The 9th Edition of the HiPipo Music Awards, went down on Friday 29th May, 2020 evening in a virtual event owing to the global outbreak of the Corona Virus Pandemic.\n\nThe glamorous live streamed event revealed the winners in over 40 HiPipo Music Awards categories as voted by the music fans from across Africa.\n\nIt was also spiced up with top notch performances from Sheebah Karungi, Kenneth Mugabi, Roden Y Kabako, Triplets Ghetto Kids, Kian Banks, Triple S, and any others.\n\nTopping the highlights of the evening, singers Eddy Kenzo and John Blaq stunned the award categories with three and four accolades respectively, better than any other nominees.\n\nEddy Kenzo and John Blaq won three and four categories respectively out of their nominations\n\nCheck out the full list of winners:\n\nAfrica:\n\nAfrica\u2019s Number 1 \u2013 Eddy Kenzo (Uganda)\n\nAfrica Song of The Year Bigtril \u2013 Parte After Parte (Uganda)\n\nBest Song from Francophone Africa Innoss\u2019B \u2013 Yope (DRC)\n\nBest Song from Western Africa Joeboy \u2013 Baby (Nigeria)\n\nBest Song from Southern Africa King Monada- Chuwana (South Africa)\n\nBest Song from Northern/Arabic Africa Mohamed Ramadan \u2013 Mafia\n\nAfrica Fans Favorite Fresh Talent \u2013 Mbosso (Tanzania)\n\nEast Africa:\n\nKenya Best Act Otile Brown X Khaligraph Jones \u2013 Japo Kidogo\n\nTanzania Best Act Diamond Platnumz \u2013 The One\n\nRwanda Best Act Deejay Pius \u2013 Homba Homboka (High Heels)\n\nBurundi Best Act Natacha -Ufise Gute\n\nEast Africa Super Hit Diamond Platnumz \u2013 The One (Tanzania)\n\nUganda:\n\nArtist of The Year \u2013 Eddy Kenzo\n\nBest Female Artist \u2013 Sheebah\n\nBest Male Artist \u2013 Eddy Kenzo\n\nBest Breakthrough Artist \u2013 John Blaq\n\nBest A-Cappella Group \u2013 Jehovah Shalom\n\nMust Watch Talent \u2013 Lydia Bless\n\nBest DJ \u2013 DJ Slick Stuart & Dj Roja\n\nVideo of The Year Kabako \u2013 Sabisubira\n\nSong of The Year (Uganda) John Blaq \u2013 Do Dat\n\nBest Audio Producer \u2013 Ronnie on Dis One\n\nBest Video Director \u2013 Nolton And George (NG Filmz)\n\nBest Song Writer \u2013 Daddy Andre\n\nBest Hip-Hop/Rap Song Bigtril \u2013 Parte After Parte\n\nBest Soul Song Kenneth Mugabi \u2013 Oliwa\n\nBest Ragga/Dancehall Song Sheebah x Orezi \u2013 Sweet Sensation\n\nBest Reggae Song Fille & Voltage Music \u2013 Squeeze\n\nBest Band Song Chris Evans \u2013 Call Me\n\nBest Contemporary Folk Song Da Agent & Betinah Fasie \u2013 Bamungamba\n\nBest Kadongo Kamu Song Kasule Cereste \u2013 Stress Free\n\nBest Zouk Song B2C & Rema \u2013 Gutujja\n\nBest Afrobeat Song John Blaq \u2013 Do Dat\n\nBest Afropop Song John Blaq \u2013 Ebyalagirwa\n\nBest Social Message David Lutalo \u2013 Ensi\n\nBest School Act Amasomero G\u2019abazira Ba Cbs \u2013 Happy Birthday Ssaabasajja.\n\nBest Religious/Gospel Act Levixone Ft.

They are children of God; they are supposed to be peaceful. But when conflict arises, it must be changed to peace.\n\nDishonesty is one of the issues causing conflict at family and community levels in Uganda. ACORD Uganda has however been proactive enough as to take the first step and tackle this issue in Wakiso. The dishonesty in some families in Wakiso area are not caused by alien issues, it always zeros down to the issue of openness. This is not limited to the families themselves but also cuts across to the leadership. Through partnerships such as the one with Girls for Girls (G4G) dialogue, that aims to help young women develop the courage, vision, and skills to take on public leadership, ACORD Uganda is acting fast in Wakiso district to tackle this conflict.\n\nSpeaking at the G4G dialogue session recently, Nabikofu Fatumah one of the panelists of the day confirmed that dishonesty is causing conflict at family and community level. She advocated for openness among families and the community leadership to be able to foster peace. \u201cLack of transparency by the community leaders across the region. When this is achieved, the issue of dishonesty at family and community level in Wakiso district will be a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nWhat makes this issue worse is that not only Wakiso district is affected but several other districts in Uganda. It may not have happened by now, but it could happen eventually. Many youths have all witnessed conflict in one way or another and some have gone further to find out what has caused it.\n\nThe good news is that conflict negotiation, reconciliation, mediations and several other methods have been employed by ACORD Uganda to curb on conflict in the families and communities of Wakiso district and Uganda at large through peacebuilding.\n\nThe onus is on the youth of society to identify these conflicts and speak out openly about them so that we can all start a new journey to peacebuilding since we are all children of God who are supposed to be peaceful.\n\nAbout ACORD Uganda\n\nThe Agency for Cooperation and Research in Development \u2013 Uganda (ACORD-U) is a Ugandan National Non-Governmental Organisation that has worked in Uganda since 1979 with headquarters in Nsambya-Kampala and several other offices across the Country.

The firm is out to help enterprises embrace better management systems for their own survival, according to the firm\u2019s chief executive officer Felix Balintumye.\n\nThe firm has over the years developed different management systems including Sacco management, School management, Hospital management, and Church management systems, to among others register members/clients and help them keep in touch and to monitor revenue or donations that the different organisations receive.\n\nComputing Palace Technologies is among the participants in the 40-days-40-FinTechs initiative that has been organised by HiPipo under its Include EveryOne programme, in partnership with Crosslake Tech, ModusBox and Mojaloop.\n\nBalintumye said the firm competed for a slot in the project so that they can be empowered on how to integrate mobile payments in the different systems they have and the web platforms developed for their clients, who need financial payment solutions.\n\nHe said one of their latest products is an e-commerce platform, which they want to integrate using the Mojaloop software.

This means that once one connects to the Beyonic platform, they will have access to over 26 networks in the nine countries including Uganda, Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya, among others, from a single sign-on.\n\nIn 2018, Beyonic processed close to 10 million mobile money transactions across its system.\n\nBeyonic was also selected as the Instant Payment Notification (IPN) Hub successor entity, effective May 1, 2020, and it is responsible for all ongoing operational aspects of the IPN Hub including future growth.\n\nThe IPN Hub was developed by the GSMA in partnership with the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and MasterCard Foundation, to provide a single point of integration between mobile money networks and PAYG service providers in Sub-Saharan Africa, accelerating reliable access to utility services at the last mile.\n\nFollowing the successful piloting and scaling of the IPN Hub, the GSMA elected to transition it to an entity that would continue to scale it sustainability and after a rigorous selection process, it was awarded to Beyonic.\n\nThe Data House solution on the other hand is used to store data that can be used for planning purposes by their different clients.\n\nMubiru said that a lot of data is out there but it is not well organised, thus Beyonic helps companies store and make sense of such data.\n\nUnder the pricing services, Mubiru said: \u201cPayments and pricing continues to change over time. At the beginning of our journey, we were just supporting organizations but with time we found out that there was need to support fintechs and other players.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had already developed a lot of application program interfaces (APIs) so we decided to open them up for anyone that needed to use them. We made sure that our APIs integration is as short as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile others take three months to integrate, Mubiru said they ensured that theirs takes less than a month.\n\nHe said their APIs are being used by multiple partners including fintechs, e-commerce players, among others.\n\nWhile they currently operate in nine countries, Mubiru said the plan is to cover over 20 countries by 2023.\n\nMajority of its clients are women, mostly in agriculture.

That means 400 million people are banked. So this initiative in may be another five years should cause another 400 million people to get banked thanks to solutions like Mojaloop that causes interoperability,\u201d he said.\n\nThe initiative is expected to boost the on-going financial inclusion efforts in Uganda.\n\nThe 2018 FinScope survey puts Uganda\u2019s formal financial inclusion at 58%. If combined with informal, Uganda\u2019s financial inclusion jumps to 78%.\n\nProfitability\n\nKawooya noted that with such collaboration, the market for FinTechs in Uganda is destined to expand and that FinTechs will become more profitable by leveraging technology to onboard more customers.\n\nAdditionally, he said that telecoms will also be able to provide more financial services, other than the Person-to-Person and withdrawals, to do more loans, savings and insurance. The government and the non-governmental organizations will also be able to serve the vulnerable in a much better way that includes everyone.\n\nHe noted that the collaboration will see them support Kanzu Code and other participating firms to get their product to the last person so as to impact lives.\n\nUsing their expansive network of global experts, HiPipo will also offer advisory services to the participating firms.\n\nAbout Kanzu\n\nCelebrating its 6th birthday, Kanzu Code is a technology company that builds inclusive financial tools for businesses, individuals and communities.\n\nIt offers a number of tools for businesses, individuals and communities including Kanzu Banking, \u2013 a software that empowers micro-finance institutions, savings and investment groups to manage their portfolios seamlessly using reliable, user-friendly and secure web and mobile technology.\n\nThe other tools are Kanzu Money, which allows for sending money from one mobile operator to another in a simple way, in addition to building enterprise web and mobile solutions for different businesses.\n\nThe 40 days 40 fintechs project will continue tomorrow with the second FinTech profiled.\n\nEND", "link": "https://money.hipipo.com/2020/06/08/kanzu-code-on-the-path-to-boosting-financial-inclusion/", "published": "2020-06-08T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Here is how you can win millions with BETPAWA", "author": [], "text": "Solomon Dre.\n\nThe football season is indeed on.

The Open Source Community players, such as HiPipo, Modusbox, Crosslake are coming together to ensure that Africa at large and Uganda in particular, is at the forefront of financial inclusion.\u201d\n\nPatrick Adengo, a digital-financial inclusion expert at Stalworth Consulting Group, said Mojaloop is a good way to combine all the key players in the inclusive finance industry.\n\nThe developers\u2019 workshop is part of the Include EveryOne summit slated for today at Mestil Hotel Kampala. The summit is expected to attract over 200 participants from across Africa, to explore the strategic trends and technologies that are shaping the future of financial inclusion, digital, IT and business.", "link": "https://www.hipipo.com/2019/11/25/hackmojaloop/", "published": "2019-11-25T00:00:00"}, {"title": "The 2020 Include Everyone program", "author": [], "text": "Write CSS OR LESS and hit save.

Beyonic came to help institutions reduce the use of cash in all their systems. We are here to support and promote a cashless efficient economy,\u201d Ian Mubiru, the Beyonic Country Director said.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs the fintech space matured, the contrast between the simplicity promised by a digital ecosystem and the cost, complexity, and risk of cash payments became increasingly stark. Payments are hard; especially in emerging markets, and particularly in the last mile. Thus, Beyonic set out to make them easy.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mubiru, Beyonic is helping free its clients from non-core roles so as to focus on making their businesses and communities thrive.\n\nIts solutions include access, data house and pricing services.\n\nUnder Beyonic access, it enables instructions to access over 26 telecoms from across nine countries in Africa. This means that once one connects to the Beyonic platform, they will have access to over 26 networks in the nine countries including Uganda, Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya, among others, from a single sign-on.\n\nIn 2018, Beyonic processed close to 10 million mobile money transactions across its system.\n\nBeyonic was also selected as the Instant Payment Notification (IPN) Hub successor entity, effective May 1, 2020, and it is responsible for all ongoing operational aspects of the IPN Hub including future growth.\n\nThe IPN Hub was developed by the GSMA in partnership with the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and MasterCard Foundation, to provide a single point of integration between mobile money networks and PAYG service providers in Sub-Saharan Africa, accelerating reliable access to utility services at the last mile.\n\nFollowing the successful piloting and scaling of the IPN Hub, the GSMA elected to transition it to an entity that would continue to scale it sustainability and after a rigorous selection process, it was awarded to Beyonic.\n\nThe Data House solution on the other hand is used to store data that can be used for planning purposes by their different clients.\n\nMubiru said that a lot of data is out there but it is not well organised, thus Beyonic helps companies store and make sense of such data.\n\nUnder the pricing services, Mubiru said: \u201cPayments and pricing continues to change over time. At the beginning of our journey, we were just supporting organizations but with time we found out that there was need to support fintechs and other players.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had already developed a lot of application program interfaces (APIs) so we decided to open them up for anyone that needed to use them. We made sure that our APIs integration is as short as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile others take three months to integrate, Mubiru said they ensured that theirs takes less than a month.\n\nHe said their APIs are being used by multiple partners including fintechs, e-commerce players, among others.\n\nWhile they currently operate in nine countries, Mubiru said the plan is to cover over 20 countries by 2023.\n\nMajority of its clients are women, mostly in agriculture. It is also working with a number of Saccos that offer loans to farmers.\n\nBeyonic is among the firms taking part in the 40-days-40-FinTech initiative, organised by HiPipo under its Include EveryOne programme, in partnership with Crosslake Tech, ModusBox and Mojaloop.\n\nThe initiative seeks to enable FinTechs to innovate solutions that facilitate cross-network financial transactions at minimal risks to enhance access to financial services.\n\nThe initiative will see the participating 40 FinTechs acquire interoperable development skills to improve access to financial services, using the Mojaloop open source software.\n\nMubiru applauded HiPipo for the 40-days-40-fintechs initiative, saying the discussion of interoperability with Mojaloop is timely, as the market needs as much solutions as possible.\n\nThe HiPipo CEO \u2013 Innocent Kawooya said that Beyonic has played a great financial inclusion role in the markets where it operates.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that the Beyonic products and services are impacting thousands of people at the last mile. It fits well in the 40-days- 40-fintechs initiative because theirs is a prime story that is transforming the financial sector,\u201d Kawooya said.\n\nHe added: \u201cGoing forward, as stakeholders we must collaborate and together develop products and services that serve our people. Alone, we may fail, but as a group, we shall overcome all road blocks and collectively serve our people.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the 40-days-40-fintechs initiative, HiPipo is also organizing a Fintechs Landscape Exhibition in mid July 2020.", "link": "https://www.hipipo.org/2020/06/12/40days40fintechs-beyonic-is-at-the-centre-of-facilitating-a-shift-to-a-cashless-uganda/", "published": "2020-06-12T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Alpteq ICT Solutions; serving the underserved. #40Days40FinTechs continues.", "author": [], "text": "Our Reporter.\n\nAlpteq ICT Solutions is a Financial Technology Company (FinTech) with a mission to become a leader in providing homemade solutions that mostly target the underserved population.\n\nFounded in 2018, the FinTech offers a wide range of ICT solutions to women, schools and people in the informal sector, using innovative products.\n\nIt has over the last one year innovated three major products that can be easily used by the public. These are Easelend, POS UG and School Novas.\n\nEaselend is a Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization (Sacco) software that is meant to help Saccos automate their day-to-day operations and finance management. Given that most Saccos operate informally, they find it difficult to manage daily operations and the software thus helps them to track members\u2019 deposits, gives all Sacco members a credit score and helps them manage saccos expenses, thus ensuring transparency.\n\n\u201cMost saccos are women dominated. They need support to grow because when you empower a woman, you have empowered a full nation. Easelend is the software that all these Saccos need,\u201d The Alpteq ICT solutions Team Leader Fred Musisi says.\n\nThe POS UG product on the other hand helps small businesses easily do book keeping. It targets the sector that most people do not wish go to.\n\n\u201cWe found out that informal traders in downtown have booking keeping and expenses management challenges and that is why developed this solution,\u201d Musisi notes.\n\nPOS UG, tracks expenses, sales and incomes of the business and helps the business to know its financial health position at every moment.\n\nAbout 100 shops in downtown Kampala are already using this product since its launch at the end of 2019. Those using it are already giving positive feedback.\n\nMusisi nonetheless notes that while the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on their rollout, they are on course.\n\nPOS UG is in the process of getting a financial management module that will enable its users to save and borrow from the POS community members.\n\nGood for Teachers, Parents and Students.\n\nAlpteq ICT solutions\u2019 third product is School Novas, a product that helps schools manage their operations easily yet also allowing pupils to revise at their convenience.\n\n\u201cJust like other businesses, schools also have challenges of managing finances. Remember many teachers are ladies so they are badly hit by this mismanagement,\u201d Musisi says.\n\nHe notes that due to high demand, they are introducing an e-learning module in the School Novas product to enable students easily revise on their own at home at a subsidized cost to be done via mobile money or payments cards.\n\nMusisi applauded HiPipo for organising the 40-days-40 FinTechs initiative, saying that the project has given them a chance to learn, share ideas and also come to speed with latest technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about the future of FinTechs and tech lovers in Uganda,\u201d he says.\n\nAlpteq is one of the firms taking part in the 40-days-40-FinTech initiative, organised by HiPipo under its Include EveryOne programme, in partnership with Crosslake Tech, ModusBox and Mojaloop. The firm featured on day 3 of the project.\n\nThe initiative seeks to enable FinTechs to innovate solutions that facilitate cross-network financial transactions at minimal risks to enhance access to financial services.\n\nThe initiative will see the participating 40 FinTechs acquire interoperable development skills to improve access to financial services, using the Mojaloop open source software.\n\nThe HiPipo CEO Innocent Kawooya says: \u201cI am happy to see developers such as Alpteq thinking widely and boldly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 40-days-40-FinTechs initiative was designed to tell the prime financial inclusion stories of Uganda and Africa. One of those stories is that of Alpteq team. Their three main products target a huge base \u2013 schools, informal traders, retail, wholesale shops and Saccos. Many of these are dominated by women. It is nice to see more companies targeting women,\u201d Kawooya notes.\n\nHe notes that as an open source software, Mojaloop will help Alpteq create an interoperable payment solution that would see all its three products communicating to each other.\n\n\u201cMojaloop will help you break all the barriers and create one ecosystem that will benefit everyone.

Both were pursuing their childhood dream of taking over the world.\n\nIt specialises in added value and advanced credit services with emphasis in the mobile payment space.\n\nIt offers a range of products including bulk payments, mainly for Small and Mid-sized Enterprises (SMEs) that desire to pay their employees, staff or casual labourers but who do not have the \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 requirements to open bank Accounts. They help them do bulky payments through mobile money.\n\nKastiro applauded HiPipo for the initiative, saying it has given them publicity by showcasing their products.\n\nAdditionally, he said that HiPipo\u2019s collaboration and partnership with Mojaloop is helping them further understand and appreciate the role of payments in financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cHiPipo is giving us that platform that we need to get the products out there; they are giving us the platform that we need to acquire customers, and to get the necessary stakeholders on board in terms of regulation and partnerships,\u201d Kastiro said.\n\nInnovative brains\n\nThe HiPipo CEO, Innocent Kawooya applauded Mallan for the innovative brains, saying that it has an amazing story and many forward thinking people.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that I would credit Mallan team for is that they have got an amazing and very organised team that is ready to go to the market and make a difference,\u201d Kawooya said.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we speak about transforming millions of lives using financial technology, one of the most important aspects of transformation is understanding and appreciating the benefits technology can do for our people and our lives.\u201d\n\nHe also commended Mallan for building amazing interoperable solutions that will serve people at the bottom of the pyramid.\n\n\u201cMallan has products that work with Saccos, which are amazing; it is trying to break the traditional ways of saving money in boxes and locking it with a padlock. That is very important for us to have as a service and as a thought for an organisation like them that is in financial technology,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe added that Mallan is already embracing the use of Mojaloop, an amazing standard that is globally accepted and which works with the Global System for Mobile Communications Association Application Program Interface specifications.\n\n\u201cWe are sure when they are developing a solution off Mojaloop, it will be interoperable, convenient, reliable and very secure because they have all those standards in the solution they are developing,\u201d Kawooya explained.\n\nAs an ecosystem advocate, Kawooya pledged that HiPipo will support all the FinTechs that they are engaging by ensuring that they advocate for simpler regulation with the regulators and partners such as Mobile Money Operators and banks to enable them integrate much easier. He also pledged to help them on publicity so as to enable the public know the kind of products they offer.\n\nGoing forward, Mallan intends to play a great role in driving financial inclusion in Uganda, right from access to the right financial products to financial literacy and how people can interact with the different technologies available to appreciate systems and the processes.\n\nFinancial inclusion in Uganda is estimated at 78%, with formal financial inclusion estimated at 58%, according to the 2018 FinScope survey.", "link": "https://www.hipipo.org/2020/06/09/yassako-mallan-company-limited-helping-you-access-electricity-on-credit/", "published": "2020-06-09T00:00:00"}, {"title": "#HiPipoMusicAwards #WeTheBest Lock Down Edition -2020 Winners", "author": [], "text": "Golden Medal of Honour for Supporting Preservation Ugandan Sound and Identity.\n\nGen.

There would be nothing for us to stand for \u2013 nothing, just blank passages in our books of Uganda. We have all interfaced with boda bodas in different ways, we love to hate them, but we also hate that we love them. For all the good and the bad, boda bodas remind us of ourselves, our shortcomings, and yet despite our flaws, there is good that comes out of us.\n\nWe sang about boda bodas. It could be Maurice Kirya or even the woman who has been the subject of different lyrics. Don\u2019t you all remember Zuena and her musical stint? What would life for Najjera peeps, aka Najjerians, be without boda bodas? We all know these Subaru drivers keep asking their girls to use boda bodas and they will refund on arrival. If Subaru drivers did not have cars, they would make good boda boda riders. In fact, it is rumoured that many of them are former boda boda users.\n\nYet, boda bodas teach many of us how to drive. The recklessness of boda bodas forces all these road users to pay extra attention. A boda boda could come out of anywhere. They are like ghosts. There is no better school of defensive driving than this city where boda bodas define our life.\n\nWe cannot forget the \u2018bibozibozi\u2019 of boda boda riders. These guys will have a say about everything. Sometimes you just want to sit quietly, on the journey but boda riders will not allow it. The best of conversations happen on these boda bodas. The riders will assure you of the wonders they have done out of the business. Of how they now own shops kumasitoowa in Nansana. Before long, they turn to you for therapy. They will seek advice about their relationships. Boda boda riders claim to know everything about everyone. You are passing some house and they assure you how the resident is a \u2018big fellow\u2019 in government. That he is the one who advises Museveni on everything.\n\nWho does not enjoy the haggling process? That moment when you flag down the boda rider and seek their services. Do you notice that the riders will charge you based on your \u2018masappe\u2019? Lawyers have suffered with the haggling process. Given that most of them are in ties and suits, boda riders never spare them the high prices. You then see them haggling in sign language before flagging down the bike. They will show the sign of a fist to assure the boda boda that all they have is 5K.\n\nBoda bodas will never accept that sometimes they have no idea about a place or a certain location. You can ask the boda boda to take you to \u2018George Floyd\u2019 and he will reply; \u201ctuula, nkuminya.\u201d They will keep riding until such a point when they are like: \u201cBoss, mpozi which place?\u201d Then he will start seeking directions from other boda riders. Ugandans are eager to give directions, but they also do a poor job giving them. Finally, it will all end with a humble confession: \u201cBoss, George Floyd is where?\u201d\n\nIt is also rumoured that the big threat to Kampala marriage is boda riders. Whereas Ugandan lawyers and bankers suffer from cash flow problems, it is not an issue for boda riders. The boda man will always have something for his wife every day. Mbu they are available, emotionally and physically. They will not claim how it is not yet payday. For bodas, every hour is pay hour. But the boda riders also know one thing that most men don\u2019t, that\u2019s the art and science of giving compliments.\n\nA boda rider will notice things even a lady has never noticed about herself. They will praise every strand of hair on her head. They will whistle: \u201cBambi Beyonce, come I take you.\u201d These compliments are a rarity in most relationships. Ugandan men need to learn from Luo men. Some lady said the way Luo men say the word \u2018baby\u2019, you can feel one\u2019s ovaries twerking. But hey, do not make a mistake to flag down a boda when in the presence of a pretty lady. They will charge you to the neck. They will strike the spear right into a man\u2019s ego.\n\nWe all know that with this traffic jam in Kampala, there is only one solution \u2013 boda bodas. If not for Boda bodas, some of us would have missed flights, job interviews, dates, sure wins from Makindye girls, even funerals. Because of boda bodas, our life has gotten better, not worse. The accidents could be the humble price we pay for the efficiencies of boda bodas. How would some women know about their co-wives if not for the gossip channels of boda bodas?\n\nWe hope sooner than later, we can restore our hate and love relationship with boda bodas. We hope we can get back to those adventurous night outs as bodas drop us home and both parties fear each other. We hope we can get back to the moments when bodas dent our cars yet claim to be the ones in the right?\n\nBoda bodas may be a burden, but it is a burden we want to carry. At such a time when we do not need this burden any longer, our pockets shall speak. #Bodabodalivesmatter\n\nTwitter: ortegatalks", "link": "https://www.sqoop.co.ug/202006/columnists/ian-ortega/boda-bodas-for-the-love-of-these-things.html", "published": "2020-06-12T00:00:00"}, {"title": "I was a loyal employee for 21 years but was treated like trash \u2013 Fat Boy \u2013 Sqoop \u2013 Get Uganda entertainment news, celebrity gossip, videos and photos", "author": ["Isaac Ssejjombwe", "Job Bwire", "Nicolas Akasula", "Lawrence Ogwal"], "text": "James Onen alias Fat Boy is one of the longest serving radio personalities in Uganda given his 21-year stint on the airwaves in Uganda.\n\nThe 44-year-old was last Wednesday fired from Sanyu FM alongside several other presenters for allegedly absconding from work.\n\nHe was hosted on KFM Friday morning where he denied claims of absconding from work.\n\nAccording to him, none of the radio employees, owned by property mogul, Sudhir Ruparelia, had absconded from work before the sacking.\n\nHe said a day before he was fired, he received a phone call from his head of department asking him not report for work until management sorted out some issues with the proprietor.\n\n\u201cWe were called back by management and next thing were emails that we had been fired.

Of what importance or how can he even help NRM? To tell us about the Ghetto? You\u2019re so stupid. Why did you grow up in the Ghetto? You ran away from home and you ended up growing up in the Ghetto,\u201d said Maj Gen Ggwanga who carried himself with such an independent mind that political correctness had no borderline on his tongue.\n\nIn response, Bebe Cool wrote,\u201d \u201cSir, retired major general Kasirye Gwanga, you have my full respect and you will always have it despite the fact that you disrespect me, a person you have never met or interacted with.\u201d\n\nMaj Gen Ggwanga saw himself only as a hero.

We all had those songs we just couldn\u2019t get enough of in this lockdown. Long after Covid-19 has been defeated, these will be the songs we shall have to thank, for the good times as we kept home, writes Ian Ortega.\n\n1. Utawezana \u2013 Femi One\n\nWhile we all sat down in peace, a one Azziad came and restored the legacy of Kenyans. For long it had been decided that Kenyans were allergic to proper dance strokes. It took a female goddess, the wasp waist of Azziad to save Kenyans from a lifetime of shame. No matter what everyone else did, she could not be challenged. At our worst, we sent in Sheilah Gashumba to represent, only to suffer a bigger loss. The one Swahili word every Ugandan learned in this lockdown was \u2018Utawezana\u2019 but trust Ugandans to never get their Swahili what \u2013 many still insist on calling it tutawezana or twawezana. Above all, we all remembered the mighty \u2018Okonkwo\u2019. It is now said, if she cannot dance to Utawezana, then she is not the one.\n\n2. Mu Curfew \u2013 A Pass\n\nFor the Najjera fellows who managed to throw block parties, this song hit differently. There is one condition to enjoying this song; you must have a balcony overlooking some skyline. You get to the balcony at midnight, carry up a glass of whisky, then you will know why this song is worth your time. If you stay in Nansana, you may have to pass up this song.\n\n3. Kwata Essimu \u2013 Freeboy ft Winnie Nwagi\n\nTo imagine that Winnie Nwagi accidentally jumped onto this track and went on to perfectly blend with Freeboy is something commendable. Freeboy brought to us that \u2018laissez-faire\u2019 style, with a Bakisimba beat to it. The lyrics were just out of the world. While Sheebah was singing, \u2018six him general\u2019, Freeboy sang about the girl who left him destitute and eating \u2018mputa\u2019. That ability to bring the luga-english flair to the lyrics makes you addicted. And hey, TikTok did not spare us the challenge. Family after family jumped onto the #kwataessimu challenge.\n\n4. Fess ka fe Bang \u2013 DJ Madness ft MOB\n\nFess Ka Fe Bang is a song that got us grooving during the lockdown but the one thing we cannot do is mention the singer. Despite being almost one month old, as per YouTube, the song is perhaps one of those that has had endless challenges on TikTok, aka the lockdown social platform. Because of its catchy beat that had any moves get way, the song got everyone in upbeat mood. It is an irresistible beat, to say the least.\n\n5. Repeat It \u2013 Azawi\n\n\n\nThe one good thing Tweny Tweny hit us with, is Azawi. It is said that hard times tend to produce great artistes. Azawi is that artiste. The lockdown took effect before we could fully enjoy Repeat It. To put it aptly, we were still hanging over from Quinamino, so for the majority, Repeat It became another lockdown anthem. The one thing you cannot accuse Azawi of, is lacking talent. She is pure at her game. You cannot help but love what she does and how she does it. That smile alone is to tell everyone that she has come to redefine this space. The only thing we do not wanna repeat is the lockdown.\n\n6. Jerusalema \u2013 Master KG ft Nomcebo\n\nFor all the Rosies in the world, this was the lockdown song. For this song, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You must listen to it. From the onset, it feels like a trip to some new world. It came at the time when we were all longing for a time we could travel again, hang out with friends, pack our bags and head to Nyege Nyege. It made us get optimistic about the post-lockdown world. In these times, we all wanted to sing out: \u2018Uhambe Nami\u2019 literally translated to mean \u2018walk with me\u2019. If house music is your thing, then you want to taste the \u2018kwaito\u2019 hidden in Jerusalema. When we finally get to party again, gangos will have to dance to this song. It is the perfect picnic song as you munch on nyama choma.\n\n7. Nakyuka \u2013 Sheebah\n\n\n\n\u201cSix one him General, lockdown Joel alemeddekko nalo\u201d those are the lyrics that welcome you to this song. It turns out, this means: \u201cGeneral Yoweri Museveni is not about to lift the lockdown\u201d. The rest of the lyrics are jumbled and require you to put in some time as you figure out the entire plot. Queen Karma is irresistible, no surprise within weeks the song is past the 500K views mark. The lockdown changed us and our relationships. Some relationships became weaker, others\u2026 they became stronger. For the ones where lockdown made things better, this song speaks to us.\n\n8. Bintwala \u2013 Mun G\n\nWithout a Mun G song, it cannot count as a lockdown. With one word, Mun G has the ability of summarising a situation. Let\u2019s confess, we all felt like things were taking us. With every passing day, came new cases and new measures. We could not jog anymore; we could not drive anymore. And hey, companies were announcing job cuts and salary reductions. We needed some musical medication, a way to make fun of our misery. Bintwala is us making fun of this hard moment, knowing deep down that we shall overcome.\n\n9. After Quarantine \u2013 Hatim and Dokey\n\nResolution after resolution. People have made post-lockdown plans. They plan to start new businesses; do all the things they had always put on hold. Everyone got a plan or two. We cannot wait to see some people; we cannot wait to travel to some spots. Hatim and Dokey get into our minds and together we can make the post-lockdown bucket list. Well, Subaru guys have one thing\u2026 to do those drifts.\n\n10. Wakayima \u2013 Bebe Cool\n\nBebe Cool has stayed clear of all the wrong news in this lockdown. He spoke out against the MPs and their Shs20m stack. He gave us a Covid-19 song. He donated to the task force. Imagine, he even had a birthday cake for Chameleone\u2019s birthday. As if not to be done, he decides to gift us with a perfect music video. If he is not playing those hare tricks on us, then he is really into some reformation.", "link": "https://www.sqoop.co.ug/202006/features/celebrity-profiles/songs-that-will-forever-remind-us-of-lockdown.html", "published": "2020-06-12T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Sudhir asks Fat Boy, other sacked employees to reapply for jobs \u2013 Sqoop \u2013 Get Uganda entertainment news, celebrity gossip, videos and photos", "author": ["Damali Mukhaye", "Job Bwire", "Carol Beyanga", "Isaac Ssejjombwe", "Lawrence Ogwal", "Andrew Kaggwa"], "text": "Property mogul Sudhir Ruparelia on Thursday asked all the sacked staff at Sanyu FM to reapply for their jobs.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ruparelia sacked all his staff at Sanyu FM after he said that they rejected the 25 per cent salary reduction the company subjected them to.\n\nHowever, Daily Monitor has learnt that the company\u2019s top managers met the heads of departments and agreed to pardon the sacked staff whom they said \u201capologised\u201d to management.\n\nA source who attended the meeting but preferred anonymity to speak freely said that the staff begged management to return to work because they were misled by one of their colleagues.\n\nThe source said that the top managers during the meeting agreed that all those who had absconded but wanted to return must re-apply for their jobs.\n\nHowever, while appearing on KFM\u2019s breakfast show, D\u2019Mighty Breakfast on Friday morning, James Onen, commonly known as Fat Boy, disagreed with claims by management that they absconded from work as to the reason they were sacked.\n\nMr Onen, accused management of operating illegally, adding that the pay cut was seen coming but the manner in which they (management) did it was shady.\n\nOnen explained that they had seen the pay cut coming given the fact that media is one of the industries that have been greatly affected by the pandemic. He said they were only hoping it does not happen but it did, which they understood.\n\n\u201cI want to set the record straight, it is not true whatsoever that the staff rejected the pay cut, this narrative is false. We had been anticipating that there could be a pay cut and we were bracing ourselves for it. It finally happened but we were not notified in writing or in any way, we only realised when we looked at our pay slips and saw that the money had been cut by 25 per cent, we just moved on with work and only hoped things would improve,\u201d Onen said.\n\nWe were still showing up to work and were still working, so it\u2019s not true that we refused to work because of salary cut.\n\nThe management of Sanyu FM has also reportedly received a list of some people who have been recommended to take over the jobs of all those who have left.\n\nWhen contacted yesterday, Mr Rajiv Ruperelia, the Managing Director of Ruparelia Group confirmed the development. He reiterated that all those who wish to return should reapply.\n\n\u201cGood enough, some of the staff have already admitted their mistake and have apologized,\u201d he said.\n\nMedia was on Wednesday awash with the news on the sacking of Sanyu FM employees when they reportedly \u201chijacked\u201d the company\u2019s twitter account and asked all lawyers who were ready to take on their boss to come on board.\n\n\u201cWe are considering legal actions against Sanyu FM for wrongful and unfair dismissal. Any lawyer who is ready to take on Ruparelia, please get in touch with us,\u201d read one of the tweets.\n\nThe boycott\n\nAbout the boycott, Onen explained that it was the initiative by their line managers who drafted a letter of displeasure at the deductions and made each of the staff to sign against it. He added that because it was the managers doing this, the staff complied and signed with a mind that perhaps they (line managers) have leeway with the owners of the company.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m being scapegoated in this case. My immediate supervisor called me one evening and told me not to work the next day, he said it was a step taken until the matter is resolved and that is how we did not work, only to be shocked by an accusation that I was absconding from duty.

Barbara Akite caught up with Samuel Abura, the founder of Sound Blast Brothers about his journey into deejaying.\n\nTell us about yourself and Sound Blast Brothers\n\nThe one thing I cannot hide about myself is that I am a family man, a husband and father. Sound Blast Brothers, is a DJ duo of two brothers; DJ Pricah and I (DJ Abbra).\n\nGrowing up, we were the selectors on the village and the demand for our services was very high during the festive season.\n\nWe actually did not know that it was our calling until life pushed us into making it serious. As far as the management of the group is concerned, we are currently doing it ourselves.\n\nWhat inspired you to start deejaying?\n\nI got into the industry in such a dramatic way. I say so because I only deejayed to earn money to meet my basic needs while in high school. However, I got moved and inspired by some serious DJs that I interacted with after school.\n\nHow do you balance working as a health worker and deejaying?\n\nI have predictable schedules and booking calendars, so I do not mix the two. I go about my daily job as a health worker and if one needs my services as a deejay, they have to book in advance in order to give me time to programme myself because I do not deal with emergency bookings.\n\nWould you drop health work for deejaying?\n\nYes, because I would need more time to concentrate on the other, though I am not sure which one I would drop.\n\nWhat makes you different as a DJ?\n\nI get lots of positive feedback from my clients and audience about my crowd management and playlist. I always have something new to bring to the stage and sometimes, I go an extra mile by picking anyone and doing a short dance competition.\n\nWhat have you achieved from deejaying?\n\nEstablishing my brand and keeping it firm amid the stiff competition from bigger brands. It was not easy.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in the next five years?\n\nAs Sound Blast Brothers, we expect to be one of the most celebrated DJs in the country, considering that we are the only DJ duo upcountry.\n\nWhat advice would you give to upcoming deejays?\n\nThey should know the demand of the industry, set their goals clearly and work hard to achieve the set goals.\n\nTell us about your education background\n\nI started from St Kizito Nursery School, went through Kampala Modern Nursery and Primary School to St Peter\u2019s College Tororo then later joined Lira School of Comprehensive Nursing on government sponsorship. It is here that I attained a certificate in nursing and I am still furthering my education since it is an endless process.", "link": "https://www.sqoop.co.ug/202006/features/celebrity-profiles/liras-dj-abbra-a-nurse-spinning-discs.html", "published": "2020-06-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Nansana! Nansana! Nansana! Indeed omwavu wakufa! \u2013 Sqoop \u2013 Get Uganda entertainment news, celebrity gossip, videos and photos", "author": ["Ian Ortega", "Ian Ford Nkera"], "text": "We have talked neighbourhoods in this city, but nothing has come close to the fun and jokes that come with Nansana\u2026and it is not just because Sizzaman sang about it.\n\nIan Ortega\n\nWhile the country was still dealing with Najjera and its Subaru drivers, Nansana happened. If Najjera was starved for attention, Nansana was being starved of love. To imagine Nansana, one must imagine Lukwago with teary eyes ranting: \u201cMujooga, mujooga, mujooga.\u201d\n\nFor now, it looks like there is no greater punishment than choosing to live in Nansana. The only closer punishment is being an OB of Ntare School. For how on earth would Ntare chaps rant about a humble opinion piece? How on earth would they be that drained when it comes to humour? I suspect that Nansana could be an extension of Ntare\u2019s Pioneer House.\n\nNo matter how far you go in life, Nansana stays with you. You cannot escape Nansana. You can leave Nansana, but Nansana will never leave you. But what is the connection between Nansana, Muteesa Royal and Kyambogo University? If you cannot see the connection, there is a high possibility you are from Nansana.\n\nIt is claimed that while Najjera people were throwing block parties amid the lockdown, Nansana households were engaged in a silver fish competition. It was about which household could figure out a brand-new recipe for the mukene.\n\nThe saying omwavu wakuffa originated out of Nansana. Whereas in Najjera it is traffic jam for Subarus and Altezzas, in Nansana it was a do and die between taxis, boda bodas and Raums. Whatever thing the best of Nansana saw in a Raum, none of us can explain.\n\nSpeak to an average uber driver and they will tell you one thing: They dread trips to Nansana. For one simple reason, \u201cIf you make a trip to Nansana, expect no return trip.\u201d\n\nNo one ever orders an uber out of Nansana. Even when you send transport to a girl in Nansana, she will still jump onto a boda boda and save the balance. It is in Nansana where the art of bargaining was invented. If you are selling anything to a Nansana person, they will always assume you are taking them for a ride. If you tell a Nansana person it costs Shs10,000, they will stare you in the eyes with a folded fist to indicate their offer of Shs500.\n\nIf you can make it in Nansana, you can make it anywhere else in this country. It takes special talent to live here. It is said that in the evening, all the beautiful girls of Nansana gather \u2018ku masitoowa\u2019 and show off to the rest of the world in their jeggings.\u201d At one point, it was even rumoured that the dudes in Nansana used to send \u2018call-back\u2019 messages.\n\nUganda did not give up on Nansana, it is Nansana that gave up on Uganda. Otherwise why would a whole area spend Friday night watching \u2018kyi kyolifa tewelabidde?\u2019 One of these days, Nansana people will go on a protest with the hashtag, #NansanaLivesMatter.\n\nWe sit down and pray that there never comes a day when Najjera and Nansana unite. We cannot imagine what kind of offspring they would produce. When you have a Najjera-Nansana couple, one would not be mistaken to sing, \u201cThey found love in a hopeless place.\u201d Some may argue that there is a connection between Nansana and the sun, aka \u2018omusana\u2019.\n\nBut then, we also know that may years ago when Bobi Wine sang about light, aka katala, he could have had Nansana in mind.\n\nBut it is not all dark and gloom in Nansana.\n\nIf you are looking for down-to-earth people, look no further than Nansana. Dating a Nansana girl will give the man all the peace he needs in the world. First, they will not pressure you to a date at Caf\u00e9 Javas. None of them knows about it. They are happier spending the weekend home, cooking for their man and doing all the chores. Behind every successful man in Kampala, is a great Nansana girl.\n\nThey are the only ones who still iron shirts and have those permanent lines, sharp enough to cut through a skin. Nansana girls will not complain about gas being finished, all they want are those \u2018bu-sticks\u201d used to light charcoal stoves.\n\nYou can expect that your Nansana girlfriend will not complain about their expired pay-TV. No one does pay-TV in Nansana, everything there is free-to-air.\n\nLet\u2019s also not forget that Nansana has a President. It\u2019s none other than Pastor Wilson Bugembe. If you want peace, do not touch their President. When you ask people from Nansana about their prominent residents, their pastor will always top the list. Nansana also claims to be the hub of engineers. But when we probed further, we realised that they were talking about yinginiyaz.\n\nWhile the people of Najjera go by names such as King of Yoruba, Shannie Swts, in Nansana, everyone is known by their offspring \u2014 Maama Brighton or Taata Jowani. And if one has no offspring, then their name is translated into Luganda. Chris becomes \u2018kuliisi\u2019 while Thomas becomes \u2018Toomu.\u2019\n\nIf our government was creative enough, Nansana and Najjera would be gazetted as tourism sites. In Nansana, one would experience the best of the omuntu wawansi, in Najjera, one would experience the best of arrivalism.\n\nPS: This piece is nothing but a statement to recognise that Nansana is here and is not about to go. It is proof that finally, Nansana made it.\n\nTwitter: ortegatalks", "link": "https://www.sqoop.co.ug/202006/columnists/acute-angle/nansana-nansana-nansana-indeed-omwavu-wakufa.html", "published": "2020-06-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "A lockdown we shall always remember \u2013 Sqoop \u2013 Get Uganda entertainment news, celebrity gossip, videos and photos", "author": ["Ian Ortega"], "text": "Quarantime: Like is norm in Uganda, the drama did not cease during lockdown. There were people in the news keeping us entertained and then some. Ian Ortega reminds us of the moments.\n\nIf Prophet Mbonye had told Ugandans in their parte after parte sessions that tweny tweny would become twente twente, none of us would have believed. Therefore, the man chose to keep every detail to himself only to come out in the middle of the lockdown. He spoke of things that no eye had seen; he spoke precisely about Covid-19 and why he had chosen silence.\n\nAnother prophet of his time, the one and only Pastor Yiga made it clear to Ugandans that Covid-19 was nothing but a myth. He woke up to reality in one of the many prison cells in Uganda. Was this God\u2019s Plan? Sheilah Gashumba thought otherwise.\n\nThen Utawezana happened. Azziad became a pulobulemu in East Africa. Sheilah tried to salvage the situation but it was too late. We had no option but to retreat to the 50K caves. Before we could even breathe, Robin Kisti was back on the scene. Justine Nameere would go on to rise from the grave and then came confusion after confusion.\n\nThe confusion did not leave anyone out. The presidential briefings had everyone confused. They said private cars were allowed on the road but without drivers. That garages could open but spare parts shops remain closed. At the time, we had to wait for the LDUs to interprete everything or wait for the clarification on the President\u2019s clarification.\n\nWe shall not forget the words; \u2018however\u2019 and \u2018therefore\u2019. We were back to English class 101 as the whole country got schooled in the world of adverbs. Then Tik Tok happened. If all troubles can be linked back to one thing, it was Nansana girls jumping onto the TikTok trend. We must confess they did \u2018Kwata Essimu\u2018 justice. It was challenge after challenge after challenge.\n\nTo some people, TikTok was a gaping reminder that we need to restock our shoe closets. It is a secret often told that a dude in Bulindo and Najjera has more horsepower in his Subaru than boxers and bedsheets. Speaking of bedsheets, how many times did the people in Kulambiro change them?\n\nIt became a norm that we could only sleep after the Ministry of Health update on the Covid-19 cases. You could go to bed with everything normal only to wake up to 43 truck drivers. As we ran out of posho and beans, we began to shout enough is enough. In Brian White\u2019s voice, we spoke out; \u201cbanange aaaaah aaaaah aaaaaah\u2026. noooo nooo nooo no.\u201d\n\nThe President heard our pleas, but everything fell on the mask. Government would give every Ugandan a mask. It was not the time to discuss the size of the mask. The stomachs in Najjera cried out that night. They could no longer afford the apartment block parties, their wallets were running empty, they had come face to face with the reality of being non-essential workers. If it were not for OC Kadoogo of Najjera, there would be no Najjera left. No money, no electricity, Najjera represents the best and worst of our suburbs.\n\nWe surely needed a breather. Bobi Wine aka President of the Ghetto aka Bba wa Barbie decided to cause havoc in the house. It was \u2018Ensasage mu nyumba\u2019. Little did he know that a one Ashburg Katto was starving. The self-appointed blogger would shock the nation as he crossed over to the ruling party from People Power. We needed a pause button on the lockdown.\n\nTen pushups used to be the standard measure of fitness. In the lockdown, a 75-year-old man shocked the world when he did 30 pushups. The first 10 were perfect, but only Canary\u2019s ruler can explain the next 20. Nonetheless, we had been challenged.\n\nBut the battlefields have been set. There were men who once asked the great question: \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d Stickers did indeed show us who was who in Kampala. It is said that if a man could not afford getting a sticker, he had no business dating. Otherwise, how shall such a man fund the relationship?\n\nBut have you noticed the drop in common colds and cough? Suddenly no one is suffering from infections anymore. Could this be linked to the spike in basic hygiene? If you want to experience suffering, try to look for something in different supermarkets. You will wash hands at every point until there is nothing left to wash anymore.\n\nNow that the cars are back on the road, we hope that the city receives humble drivers. The times of people rushing as though they got the cure for Covid-19 should stop. Most of us are non-essentials. The world did not stop while we were locked home. It surely should not stop now that we are back on the roads. This message goes out to all Altezza, Mark X, and Subaru drivers. Humility does not kill.\n\nTo the rest of us, have you finally realised that we are broke people living in a broke country, working for broke companies while everyone is pretending it is fine? Small small two months and everyone is crying. We are all a month away from bankruptcy\u2026\n\nTwitter: ortegatalks", "link": "https://www.sqoop.co.ug/202005/columnists/a-lockdown-we-shall-always-remember.html", "published": "2020-05-31T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Therefore\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t mind another lockdown \u2013 Sqoop \u2013 Get Uganda entertainment news, celebrity gossip, videos and photos", "author": ["Ca Karuhanga"], "text": "Early this week, hundreds of private car owners took to streets, roads and what not across the country in celebration of the partial easing of lockdown.\n\nMillions of unmasked pedestrians before them have been permanent furniture in major trading centres and \u2018stations\u2019, with most just meeting up for an early game of ludo and crude waragi during the two months of total lockdown.\n\nThe mass attack on the streets followed guidelines announced by the President during one of his dozen Covid-19 addresses, stating that, among others, Ugandans will be able to \u2018\u2026bla bla bla.\u2019\n\nAnd trust Ugandans to \u2018bla bla bla\u2019 like their lives depended on it.\n\nOne of those drivers was yours truly, who on late Monday evening, uncovered my dusty Premio and ordered my children to wash it in anticipation of \u2018just driving to Kampala so that I can test the waters.\u2019\n\nA mechanic was also on hand to fix anybits that could have broken down, setting me back some 250K but what the hell.\n\nThe next day, I rolled out the car, right hand elbow hanging from the driver\u2019s door and a kitenge mask on, enduring a three-hour jam from Mityana to our local kafunda which was already filled up by regular patrons and some newbies craving a drink and lugambo \u2013 by noon.\n\nHere, in between drinks and skewers of roast pork delivered by the \u2018almost famous\u2019 Kyadondo Rugby Club duo of Mike and David, we cursed truck drivers, discussed the recently released Covid figures, agreed to disagree on the increasing cases of domestic violence.

The road was jammed by drivers whose cartoon brains had been marinated in local excitement because for the first time in 60-something days, they could drive their Subarus without being stopped and being asked to produce the oh-so-precious Ministry of Transport sticker. We were tired, sticky with sweat and a bit smelly too. The painter\u2019s masks we had been wearing all day did not help. They were tight as if waist trainers.

    "Declare: My code is adapted from holwech's personal blog \"Automatic news scraping with Python, Newspaper and Feedparser\", you can check it out at https://holwech.github.io/blog/Automatic-news-scraper/. The author also provided a Github download, you can check it out at https://github.com/holwech/NewsScraper. This automatic scraping tool uses Newspaper library to scraping multiple news websites at the same time. You can find the documentation of Newspaper library at https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper. \n",

    "Thanks holwech for sharing a Python code. I modified this script by adding other elements, such as keywords, summary, and authors to collect from news articles with the help of Newspaper's documentation. I also developed a method to tranfer newspaper's JSON export file to a dataframe. This script is published for study and research exploration purpose only, and it would not be used for any commercial purpose. \n",

    "I used an example of Ugandan Newspaper Json file to test hotwech's method. I will also share this file in my Github Repo. "

      "                    'text': 'In the early years of the Cold War, Canada decided to design and build the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world.\\n\\nCanada is well known for its rugged bush planes, capable of rough landings and hair-raising take-offs in the wilderness. From the late 1930s, the North American country had also started to manufacture British-designed planes for the Allied war effort. Many of these planes were iconic wartime designs like the Hawker Hurricane fighter and Avro Lancaster bomber.\\n\\nAmbitious Canadian politicians and engineers weren’t satisfied with this. They decided to forge a world-leading aircraft manufacturing industry out of the factories and skilled workforce built up during the war. Tired of manufacturing aircraft designed by others, this new generation of Canadian leaders were determined to produce Canadian designs. Avro Aircraft, the Canadian airplane maker created after the war, was the company that would deliver their dream.\\n\\nFreed from the set ways-of-thinking of Avro’s more established rivals, the firm’s engineers were able to work on revolutionary jet fighters, commercial airliners, flying saucers and even a space plane. They placed Canada at the technological cutting edge of the new Jet Age.\\n\\nIn so doing, these engineers challenged notions of what small countries like Canada could achieve in the hi-tech industries of the day, even if convincing politicians to stump up the cash for them was an altogether trickier business.\\n\\nYou might also like:\\n\\nThen came the Arrow. On 4 October 1957, 14,000 people watched a large hangar on the outskirts of Toronto open to reveal a beautiful, large, white, delta-wing aircraft. The plane was the Avro Arrow interceptor. A third longer and broader than today’s Eurofighter Typhoon, the Arrow could fly close to Mach 2.0 (1,500 mph, or the maximum speed of Concorde), and had the potential to fly even faster. It was Canada’s Can$250m (US$1,58bn today) bid to become an aviation superpower.\\n\\nThe project was genuinely ground-breaking. Avro’s engineers had been allowed to build a record-breaker without compromise. But Canadians would soon discover that the supersonic age had made aviation projects so expensive that only a handful of countries could carry them out – and Canada, unfortunately, wasn’t one of them.\\n\\nThe advert for Avro Aircraft celebrating the “first 50 years of powered flight in Canada 1909–1959” had only just been printed when on “Black Friday”, 20 February 1959, the loudspeaker of the Avro Aircraft factory on the outskirts of Toronto crackled to life. Thousands of workers heard the company president announce “that f------ prick in Ottawa” (the newly elected Canadian prime minister John Diefenbaker) had cancelled the entire Arrow programme. Later that day, 14,500 skilled men and women lost their jobs. Many of these engineers joined the brain-drain to the United States. The \"Avro group\" of 32 engineers playing critical roles in Nasa\\'s Apollo programme, which – ironically – beat the Soviets in the race to land a man on the moon.',\n",

We have several reports yesterday, and this morning, where parents have shown up to playgrounds to cut the locks on them. These are specifically in Williamsburg and in other areas of Brooklyn. You’ve gotten questions about this in the past where there’s some frustration that the playgrounds are not opening up yet. They say they are going against your orders, and cutting these locks open. So, your reaction to that — and is the city going to show up and close them again, and are you going to have to clean them up? What is the process here? A: We are not going to allow people to take the law into their own hands. It just doesn’t work. So people are not allowed to open up a playground that is not yet available to the public. It is for a reason. Look, I was very sympathetic in the beginning, to every parent, as a parent myself, why people wanted to be on those playgrounds. We tried to make it work. It wasn’t working effectively. Right now, we are not going to make a change with the playgrounds until we get to phase two. Now, Phase Two, as everyone knows, could be as early as June 22nd. I’ve said I think it’s going to take a little longer than that just to make sure we are absolutely certain. But until the order is given that playgrounds are open, people need to stay off the playgrounds. It is not appropriate to take their own action. We are doing this so we can get to Phase Two and beyond. So I understand people’s frustrations. But if folks act prematurely and that causes the disease to start spreading again, then that’s the kind of thing that undermines our ability to get to Phase Two, and stay in Phase Two. So, I know it is not easy. But people have to understand, there’s a reason for these rules — it is to help us move forward.\\n\\nHe did not explain why he, along with tens of thousands of other left-wing New Yorkers, marched in Black Lives Matter protests or protests on behalf of black transgender people, where social distancing rules were generally not observed.\\n\\nJoel B.

According to the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management COVID-19 Hospitalization Tracking Project, there were 22,639 current hospitalizations in the United States on Monday among the 42 states that keep and report that data. This is a dramatic decline from April 13, when there were 18,829 hospitalizations in New York State alone.\\n\\nSince the start of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 118,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, according to Worldometers. (The COVID Tracking Project currently lists 110,000 deaths.)

What’s clinically meaningful is that people wind up in the hospital, if people wind up certainly on ventilators or ICU’s, those are dangerous things. “The thing that we know about COVID-19 … is that your risk of getting really sick from it is incredibly dependent on your age,” Berenson added. “So if we’ve a thousand cases in nursing homes, it’s very, very different than a thousand cases at a Whirlpool plant where people are much younger, much less at a college … “I’m not saying there’s nothing to be concerned about. I’m not saying there’s nothing to watch,” Berenson continued. “We need to follow the data, just as we always have. But the media, the media just wants panic.”\\n\\nCNN reported last week, “the number of Covid-19 hospitalizations since Memorial Day has gone up in at least a dozen states: Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.”\\n\\nIn a series of tweets on Thursday, Berenson added a note of caution on reports of increases in current hospitalizations for COVID-19 in California, Texas, North Carolina, and several other states, asserting that “the media is both confused and conflating several different data points in an effort to stir hysteria.”\\n\\n“Overall hospitalizations are rising because people are returning to hospitals for elective (and in some cases very necessary) surgeries that were postponed,” Berenson tweeted, adding:\\n\\n6/ Whether or not they are symptomatic.

It’s about the rule of law… It’s about what comes next…\\n\\nLocal communities should be allowed to erect or remove whatever statues, monuments, and street names they like. If Seattle wants to erect a statue of Vladimir Lenin (and it does), a cold-blooded murderer and Hitler-like antisemite and tyrant, so be it. What the hell do I care?\\n\\nIf some southern town or city wants to erect a statue of Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis or Stonewall Jackson, what the hell do I care?\\n\\nAnd if, someday, Seattle or that southern town or city decides to removes those statues — again, what the hell do I care?\\n\\nOther than the sense of history, I feel no affinity towards the Confederacy. A few decades ago, when the left claimed the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery (this is when the left’s agenda was to deny white Americans fought a war to free the slaves), I was arguing that was ridiculous. Granted, not everyone who fought for the Confederacy fought to protect the abomination of slavery (including Robert E. Lee).\\n\\nIn fact, many who fought for the Confederacy opposed slavery (including Robert E. Lee). But of course the war was fought over slavery. And although the left currently agrees with me on that issue, it only does as a means to justify its rationale to Taliban these statues.\\n\\nSame with the Confederate flag. If it was up for a vote, I would have voted to remove the Confederate flag from South Carolina’s capitol, and I was glad when then-Gov. Nikki Haley (R-SC) removed it in 2015. It made no sense to me to fly that flag in the present tense at a state capitol, and an elected official like Haley removing it, someone with the legal power to do so, someone accountable to the voters, means it was removed in the right way.\\n\\nAt the same time, I know the Confederate flag doesn’t mean “bring back slavery” to those who fly it. It means freedom from centralized authority, it means live and let live… I live in the South where I’ve seen more than one black person sporting the Stars and Bars… Hey, is this a great country, or what?\\n\\nRobert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant were great men and great Americans. Abraham Lincoln might be the greatest American ( Jefferson Davis was a feckless, self-aggrandizing putz). Rev. Martin Luther King is a hero of mine, but so is Malcolm X, and so is Thomas Jefferson. What can I say? People are complicated. But all these men had one thing in common… They believed in freedom, and they fought for freedom, and while I never would have joined the Confederacy or the Nation of Islam, I’m also not a baby about this stuff.\\n\\nSpeaking of babies…\\n\\nThere is a valid and legal process by which to have an offending statue removed. And I respect anyone who goes about that process. Regardless of my personal belief, the law is the law is the law…The principle of the rule of law and the equal application of that rule is much more important to me than my personal opinion of a statue or cause.\\n\\nBut we are so far beyond the law now… We’re at a place where Democrats, along with the corporate media, academia, and even some historians, are championing gangsters and howling mobs tearing down and desecrating statues and monuments.\\n\\nThat’s what I oppose, that’s what sickens me, and I would oppose it if mobs targeted Seattle’s repulsive Lenin statue.\\n\\nThe very institutions that should be standing up for the rule of law — Democrats, the corporate media, academia, and historians — are applauding and excusing mob rule, vandalism, property damage, and violence.\\n\\nThose of us who oppose this appalling behavior, not just on the grounds of criminality, but who believe we should not hide our warts-and-all history, who understand that some of these Confederate monuments were erected with the best of intentions — to heal our country — are attacked as racists defending racists. And it is this argument that tells you what the Woke Taliban intend to next tear down… Which is another reason to oppose this lawlessness, even if you want Confederate statues to come down…\\n\\nBecause “racism” is the rationale of the Woke Taliban’s lawlessness and those who applaud and defend them, then nothing is safe from this lawlessness. Any monument to our Founding Fathers is eventually doomed to these mobs and vandals (this has already begun), and then they will come for the Christian Church — a Church the media and left have spent decades smearing as racist and homophobic.\\n\\nAnd then what? What comes down next?\\n\\nIt’s no secret what’s next…\\n\\nThe answers are here and here.\\n\\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.',\n",

How do you balance it with freedom of speech? If you’ve got a law, for example, saying that using someone’s preferred pronoun is mandatory — or you can be fined [for non-compliance], how do we balance that with some of these other important and even constitutional questions? Those are things that, for the most part, are unfortunately going to be just decided by a whole range of lower courts. and it will be a long time before the Supreme Court even takes up the opportunity to weigh in on that.”\\n\\nSeverino predicted, “These questions are going to create a tsunami of new litigation and create a huge amount of uncertainty going forward.”\\n\\nLISTEN:\\n\\nThe Supreme Court’s decision to extend prohibitions against employment discrimination to include sexual orientation and “gender identity” will place religious and traditional organizations at a legal disadvantage when they are inevitably sued by left-wing outfits.\\n\\n“You’re going to see these decisions going overwhelmingly in favor of the litigants [and] the plaintiffs who are challenging any religious organization, or any school, or anyone who wants to maintain a traditional, biologically based, scientific-based understanding of sex,” Severino forecasted.\\n\\n“The logic that the court embraced” sets in motion a legal momentum for lower courts to render future decisions in favor of plaintiffs suing religious and traditional organizations for their personnel decisions, Severino anticipated.\\n\\nMansour asked if religious organizations would surrender to left-wing activist groups filing lawsuits based on the Supreme Court’s decision given their insufficient resources to legally defend themselves.\\n\\nSeverino replied, “That’s part of the strategy of the activists because they know that many of these organizations can’t afford to pay for defense. They can’t afford to risk a negative judgment where they could face crippling fines. If you’re talking about individuals, you’ve seen what’s happened with cases like the Masterpiece Cake Shop case, where someone’s entire business and livelihood could be destroyed and where they can face even personal threats and real concern over their own safety if they are willing to carry on litigation.”\\n\\nSeverino added, “I think the intimidation factor of a lawsuit is huge, and when you’ve got the court almost inviting that, it’s going to present a real challenge for a lot of people. Practically speaking, for the most part, this isn’t even going to be an issue because I think there’s the vast majority of businesses don’t have any reason or desire to discriminate on either of these bases, but there are circumstances where it is either relevant to the job qualifications or where it’s going to be an issue of conscience, and those are the ones where you’re going to have people who are going to be forced to make those tough choices between violating their own conscience and possibly losing their livelihood.”\\n\\nThe Supreme Court’s decision amounted to a rewriting of civil rights legislation, Severino stated.\\n\\n“This had to do with the court interpreting the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” Severino explained. “We’re kind of familiar with this language. It says that no employers can discriminate on the basis of sex, of religion, of natural origin, and other kinds of classic caveats that you have, but what their question was, ‘It says you can’t discriminate ion the basis of sex. Does that also mean you can’t discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity?'”\\n\\nSeverino continued, “It’s kind of a strange question to be asking because in so many states, now, and in many situations in federal law, we already do have laws preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation, but they never phrase it as ‘discrimination based on sex.’ It’s always explicitly written, ‘discrimination based on sexual orientation.'”\\n\\n“What the Supreme Court did is, in an opinion, they basically just rewrote what that text said because there is a long-standing history where for decades, no politicians [and] no judge said that language meant sexual orientation, as well,” Severino added.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court’s decision usurps the role of legislators, Severino determined.\\n\\n“That’s really a revisionist reading of the statute dressed up as textualism, and that’s one of the things that is so dangerous because we have laws that courts can effectively rewrite,” Severino concluded. “No legislator who passed [Title VII of the Civil Rights Act] would have thought it meant that.”\\n\\nBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.\\n\\nFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.\",\n",

      "                    'text': 'Now may be the time to take on Boris Johnson’s “abject” leadership head-on, Nigel Farage told Breitbart News, as rumours swirl about his plans to activate the planned Reform Party and return to front-line politics.\\n\\nNigel Farage revealed to Breitbart News Daily on Sirius XM Patriot on Monday that, amidst the speculation, he was certainly considering a return to front-line politics. As the British political establishment once again finds itself in a state of confused paralysis, Mr Farage said he could give it a “good kicking politically”.\\n\\nBritish press speculated at the weekend that Mr Farage was on the verge of activating the Reform Party, a name he registered with the government’s electoral commission last year but has kept dormant. In light of those reports, Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow asked the Brexit leader what was coming next.\\n\\nWhile Mr Farage sidestepped answering the question directly, he made clear that present UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was severely underperforming and something would have to be done. He told Breitbart News: “Boris’s leadership has been abject. There is one mitigating factor, which is, of course, is that he was very seriously ill just a few weeks ago.\\n\\n“He could have died — we need to understand that… [but] It would seem with coronavirus we were too slow into lockdown, and we’re too slow out of lockdown. On China, he still seems to think Huawei is acceptable having some sort of role within our 5G system. At every level, Boris is not providing proper leadership.”\\n\\nOn his track record, Mr Farage admitted there was a precedent of him coming out of semi-retirement to force political change. He said: “Now, of course, people remember that having done my bit with UKIP, having got the referendum, having helped to win it, I did come back last year to try and save the situation with the Brexit Party because the Tories had made such a mess of it. There’s a level of media speculation which says: ‘Nigel is going to come back again and give the establishment a good kicking politically.’\\n\\n“All I will say is: let’s watch, let’s wait, let’s see. I haven’t yet decided that the time is right, but it may be.”\\n\\nAbbott to Farage: Bojo Needs His ‘Mojo’, Must Start Sending Back Illegal Boat Migrants to France https://t.co/5M6nyiaJuw — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 2, 2020\\n\\nMr Farage last re-entered politics in early 2019 when Brexit was becalmed in the doldrums, its progress frustrated by years of mismanagement by Theresa May’s government. He founded a new political party — the Brexit Party — and led it to victory in the national European Parliament election just six weeks later.\\n\\nAs Farage pushed the Conservative Party over target — and Theresa May out of office — it was taken over by Boris Johnson, who fought and won the December 2019 general election on a pro-Brexit platform. But just as Theresa May’s government was not capable, by inclination, to deliver Brexit, so Boris Johnson’s new government finds itself unequal to the — clearly unanticipated by them — culture wars suddenly sweeping Western nations.\\n\\nAs important historical monuments, including the statue of Winston Churchill, said to be Boris Johnson’s hero and role model, were vandalised by hard-left activists, Downing Street remained silent. Mr Farage reflected in his Breitbart News Daily interview: “…it has taken him nearly ten days to properly condemn those who didn’t just pull down a statue of somebody involved in the slave trade. They defaced, for two consecutive days, Winston Churchill’s statue, and they even defaced our national war memorial, to the one and a half million killed in two world wars. And it has taken Boris ten days to properly respond.”\\n\\nHaving won the Brexit wars for Britain, Mr Farage this week leaves the door open on the question of whether he will fight in its culture wars, too. He has certainly already skirmished on this matter, pointing to the hard-left Marxist programme of change being promoted by the Black Lives Matter UK organisation. As Breitbart London reported on Monday, Mr Farage was particularly clear on the threat to freedom of speech and freedom of thought.\\n\\nSpeaking to Breitbart News, the Brexit leader reflected: “It seems that the real threat we face now is a genuine threat to free speech. I have never known a time when, in the United Kingdom — which is famed for its huge breadth of media commentary and views — I have never seen so many people so scared to write and say and speak and broadcast what they think. It really is very disturbing.”',\n",

      "                    'text': 'In an interview with Politico on Sunday, Chicago Democrat Congressman Bobby Rush attacked Chicago law enforcement.\\n\\nLong-time activist and career politician Bobby L. Rush unleashed a scathing review of law enforcement officers on Sunday, comparing them to the Ku Klux Klan. “The number-one cause that prevents police accountability, that promotes police corruption, that protects police lawlessness, is a culprit called the Fraternal Order of Police,” he told Politico, calling the two organizations “kissing, hugging and law-breaking cousins”:\\n\\nThey’re the organized guardians of continuous police lawlessness, of police murder and police brutality. The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police is the most rabid, racist body of criminal lawlessness by police in the land. It stands shoulder to shoulder with the Ku Klux Klan then and the Ku Klux Klan now.\\n\\nRush’s words were part of his response to a leaked video showing police at leisure in his office on the weekend of May 30 as violent protests in response to the alleged murder of George Floyd by former officer Derek Chauvin of the Minneapolis Police raged in the streets just outside.\\n\\nThe officers — including three supervisors — napped, made coffee, and even popped some popcorn while on duty. One even left Rush a tip: a one-dollar bill placed on his desk in what Rush considers a deliberate gesture of disrespect.\\n\\nRush is not the first to criticize the video. High ranking members of the Chicago police force, as well as Mayor Lori Lightfoot, have also labeled the footage and its subjects indefensible. “Looting was going on, buildings were being burned, officers were on the front lines truly taking a beating with bottles and pipes, and these guys were lounging — in a congressman’s office,” Lightfoot said. “The utter contempt and disrespect is hard to imagine.”\\n\\nBut Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 7 president John Catanzara scolded Mayor Lightfoot for her words, contending that Rush’s own staff had asked the officers to stay in his office.\\n\\n“Shame on her for ever questioning their valor and the heroism and the officers of CPD to make it sound like they were letting other officers get the crap beat out of them while they sat there and slept,” Catanzara told local NBC affiliate Channel 5. “That is a disgusting accusation. She owes the men and women an apology for even implying that was.”',\n",

While she still has a long road ahead of her, I\\'m extremely hopeful that she\\'s going to make a full recovery,\" Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director at the Northwestern Medicine Lung Transplant Program, said during a press conference in Chicago on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Yesterday she smiled and told me this one sentence. She said, \\'Doc, thank you for not giving up on me,\\'\" Bharat said. \"If she didn\\'t get the transplant, she would not be alive.\"\\n\\nThe hospital said it believes this is the first time such an operation on a Covid-19 patient has been performed successfully in the United States, and it offers new hope for patients with extensive lung damage from coronavirus infection.\\n\\nThe patient, a Hispanic woman in her 20s, spent six weeks on a ventilator and an ECMO machine while in the hospital\\'s intensive care unit as her body fought the coronavirus infection.\\n\\n\"For many days, she was the sickest person in the Covid ICU -- and possibly the entire hospital,\" Dr. Beth Malsin, pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said in a press release Thursday.\\n\\n\"There were so many times, day and night, our team had to react quickly to help her oxygenation and support her other organs to make sure they were healthy enough to support a transplant if and when the opportunity came,\" Malsin said. \"One of the most exciting times was when the first coronavirus test came back negative and we had the first sign she may have cleared the virus to become eligible for a life-saving transplant.\"\\n\\nA need for new lungs\\n\\nIt was early June when the patient\\'s lungs showed signs of irreversible damage due to Covid-19, according to the hospital.\\n\\nTransplant surgeon Dr. Ankit Bharat while caring for the first US double lung transplant in a Covid-19 survivor.\\n\\n\"A lung transplant was the only option,\" Bharat said.\\n\\n\"She was starting to develop multi-organ failure from the result of the permanent damage that she had,\" he said. \"As a result of the severe injury, the pressure inside the lungs started to really go up and the heart then started to fail -- and when the heart starts to fail then the blood starts to back up, so the liver starts to fail and then the kidney starts to fail.\"\\n\\nBharat added that before the patient could be listed for a lung transplant, she had to test negative for Covid-19\\n\\nIt took about five weeks for the patient to clear the virus before her surgery -- and while normally a patient would be notified of the lung transplant surgery, it was too risky to wake up her while she was on a ventilator, her doctors said.\\n\\nThe young woman\\'s lungs were severely damaged after she battled Covid-19.\\n\\n\"Normally we try to wake every patient up before we offer them lung transplant. We want to make sure that the patient knows,\" Bharat said.\\n\\n\"In her situation, we tried to do the same thing, but her lungs were so badly injured we just could not wake her up,\" he said. \"We had to rely on her family, her power of attorney, her mom and her caregivers to understand her wishes and that\\'s what helped us make the decision. It\\'s an unusual situation in her case.\"\\n\\nDoctors quickly listed the young woman for a double lung transplant once it was confirmed that she tested negative for Covid-19, and the 10-hour transplantation operation was performed 48 hours later.\\n\\nThe patient\\'s family is now able to visit her in the hospital while she recovers.\\n\\n\"They\\'re quite ecstatic,\" Bharat said. \"She\\'s able to FaceTime with her family. She\\'s able to talk to her significant others.\"\\n\\n\\'There\\'s still so much we have yet to learn\\'\\n\\nMore research is needed to gather data on exactly how many severe Covid-19 patients could benefit from this operation, Bharat said during Thursday\\'s press conference.\\n\\n\"We are one of the first health systems to successfully perform a lung transplant on a patient recovering from COVID-19,\" he said. \"We want other transplant centers to know that while the transplant procedure in these patients is quite technically challenging, it can be done safely, and it offers the terminally ill COVID-19 patients another option for survival.\"\\n\\nGet CNN Health\\'s weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nBharat and his colleagues also want to learn more about the patient\\'s sickness and recovery.\\n\\n\"How did a healthy woman in her 20s get to this point?\" Dr. Rade Tomic, a pulmonologist and medical director of the Lung Transplant Program, said in the press release.\\n\\n\"There\\'s still so much we have yet to learn about Covid-19. Why are some cases worse than others? The multidisciplinary research team at Northwestern Medicine is trying to find out,\" Tomic said. \"While this young woman still has a long and potentially risky road to recovery given how sick she was with multi-organ dysfunction for weeks preceding the transplant, we hope she will make a full recovery.\"',\n",

The CDC also estimates that 40% of coronavirus transmission is occurring before people feel sick, meaning they are presymptomatic.\\n\\nBut it may boil down to how one defines \"asymptomatic.\"\\n\\n\\'There are so many unknowns\\'\\n\\nMaria Van Kerkhove, WHO\\'s technical lead for coronavirus response and head of its emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said during a media briefing in Geneva on Monday that \"it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual.\"\\n\\nBut then on Tuesday, during the live Q&A, she clarified \"this is a major unknown.\"\\n\\n\"The majority of transmission that we know about is that people who have symptoms transmit the virus to other people through infectious droplets -- but there are a subset of people who don\\'t develop symptoms, and to truly understand how many people don\\'t have symptoms, we don\\'t actually have that answered yet,\" Van Kerkhove said.\\n\\n\"We do know that some people who are asymptomatic, or some people who don\\'t have symptoms, can transmit the virus on,\" she said. \"So what we need to better understand is how many of the people in the population don\\'t have symptoms and separately how many of those individuals go on to transmit to others.\"\\n\\nOn Monday, Van Kerkhove had said that what appear to be asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 often turn out to be cases of mild disease.\\n\\n\"When we actually go back and we say how many of them were truly asymptomatic, we find out that many have really mild disease,\" Van Kerkhove said on Monday.\\n\\n\"They\\'re not quote-unquote Covid symptoms -- meaning they may not have developed fever yet, they may not have had a significant cough, or they may not have shortness of breath -- but some may have mild disease,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"Having said that, we do know that there can be people who are truly asymptomatic.\"\\n\\nVan Kerkhove added that she was referring to reports from WHO member states when she made her comments on Monday.\\n\\n\"What I was referring to yesterday in the press conference were very few studies -- some two or three studies that had been published that actually try to follow asymptomatic cases, so people who are infected, over time, and then look at all of their contacts and see how many additional people were infected,\" Van Kerkhove said.\\n\\n\"And that\\'s a very small subset of studies. So I was responding to a question at the press conference. I wasn\\'t stating a policy of WHO or anything like that,\" she said. \"Because this is a major unknown, because there are so many unknowns around this, some modeling groups have tried to estimate what is the proportion of asymptomatic people that may transmit.\"\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the day after WHO\\'s live Q&A, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the United States, weighed in on Van Kerkhove\\'s original comments. He said it \"was not correct\" to describe asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus as rare.\\n\\nEvidence shows that 25% to 45% of infected people likely don\\'t have symptoms, Fauci told ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday morning.\\n\\n\"And we know from epidemiological studies they can transmit to someone who is uninfected even when they\\'re without symptoms,\" said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\\n\\n\"So to make a statement to say that\\'s a rare event was not correct.\"\\n\\nAnd while the public might use the word \"asymptomatic\" to describe any infected person who doesn\\'t have symptoms, the bigger concern may be infection from \"pre-symptomatic\" carriers.\\n\\nHow the virus spreads\\n\\nDr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, also said during Tuesday\\'s live Q&A that there is still much to learn about the possible asymptomatic spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\n\"Whatever proportion of disease is transmitting from asymptomatic individuals, as Maria said, that is unknown,\" Ryan said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m absolutely convinced that that is occurring. The question is how much,\" he said. \"There\\'s much to be answered on this.

      "                    'text': '(CNN) The widely available steroid drug dexamethasone may be key in helping to treat the sickest Covid-19 patients who require ventilation or oxygen, according to researchers in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nTheir findings are preliminary, still being compiled and have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal -- but some not involved with the study called the results a breakthrough\\n\\nThe two lead investigators of the Recovery Trial , a large UK-based trial investigating potential Covid-19 treatments, announced to reporters in a virtual press conference on Tuesday that a low-dose regimen of dexamethasone for 10 days was found to reduce the risk of death by a third among hospitalized patients requiring ventilation in the trial.\\n\\n\"That\\'s a highly statistically significant result,\" Martin Landray, deputy chief investigator of the trial and a professor at the University of Oxford , said on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"This is a completely compelling result. If one looks at the patients who did not require ventilators but were on oxygen, there was also a significant risk reduction of about one-fifth,\" Landray said. \"However, we didn\\'t see any benefit in those patients who were in hospital, had Covid, but whose lungs were working sufficiently well -- they were not taking either oxygen or on ventilators.\"\\n\\nLandray added that \"there are outstanding questions\" and people treating Covid-19 at home should not be taking dexamethasone on the back of these results.\\n\\n\"We have not studied patients in the community,\" Landray said. \"We show no effect in the patients who are not on oxygen and we did not study the patients who are not in hospital.\"\\n\\nThe dexamethasone arm of the Recovery Trial closed last week and researchers are now compiling its data. It included about 2,100 hospitalized Covid-19 patients who were randomized to receive dexamethasone, and about 4,300 hospitalized Covid-19 patients who were randomized to receive the usual standard of care at their hospitals.\\n\\n\\'Our focus was on mortality\\'\\n\\nIn the trial, dexamethasone was provided at a dose of 6mg once a day for up to 10 days, administered either as an injection or taken orally. The researchers reported no serious adverse events among the patients taking dexamethasone, but the results are preliminary.\\n\\n\"At this stage, we found no clear adverse effects of doing this. Let\\'s recognize that there are sort of two messages here. In the people who required oxygen or ventilation, it clearly works, and the benefits are biggest for those on ventilators. In the people in hospital with Covid who do not require oxygen -- so, their lungs are working moderately well -- then actually there\\'s no benefit,\" Landray said on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"In the trial, our focus was on mortality, which obviously a drug can affect in either direction, but the overall results in the patients on oxygen and ventilation was a clear, clear benefit,\" Landray said, adding that deaths in the study were examined over a 28-day period. \"We\\'ve looked, for example, were there deaths due to other forms of infection, which are sometimes considered a risk? And the answer is no, there was no excess of any other particular cause of death.\"\\n\\nIn the United States, dexamethasone already has been used to treat some Covid-19 patients during the pandemic.\\n\\nWhen told about the preliminary Recovery Trial results, Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, the regional director for critical care at Northwell Health, which owns 23 hospitals in New York, said to CNN, \"We\\'ve used it for Covid from the beginning.\"\\n\\n\\'It\\'s a readily available, cheap and well understood drug\\'\\n\\nDexamethasone has been a controversial drug when it comes to treating respiratory viral infections, Peter Horby, chief investigator for the Recovery Trial and a professor at the University of Oxford , said on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"This was included in the Recovery Trial because it\\'s a readily available, cheap and well understood drug, and because there have been reports in the past of benefit in viral respiratory infections, but it\\'s been an area of huge controversy,\" Horby said.\\n\\n\"Even at the time of SARS1 in 2003, steroids were used, but at very different doses. Some of the studies showed a harm from steroids in SARS, some said there\\'s possible benefits. A meta-analysis in 29 different studies in SARS was inconclusive. There\\'s also been inconclusive results on MERS coronavirus and also influenza,\" Horby said. \"So really it\\'s been a huge ongoing debate as to whether you should use steroids in patients with viral respiratory diseases.\"\\n\\nThe researchers said on Tuesday that they think this now should become a standard of care in the United Kingdom for Covid-19 patients requiring either oxygen or ventilation -- but in the meantime, the Recovery Trial continues to investigate other treatment approaches.\\n\\n\\'This is a ground-breaking development\\'\\n\\n\"This is tremendous news today from the Recovery trial showing that dexamethasone is the first drug to reduce mortality from COVID-19. It is particularly exciting as this is an inexpensive widely available medicine,\" Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK Government\\'s chief scientific adviser, said in a news release from the Recovery Trial team on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"This is a ground-breaking development in our fight against the disease, and the speed at which researchers have progressed finding an effective treatment is truly remarkable,\" Vallance said. \"It shows the importance of doing high quality clinical trials and basing decisions on the results of those trials.\"\\n\\nNick Cammack, the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator lead at Wellcome Trust in the UK, said in a written statement on Tuesday that the dexamethasone findings are a \"major breakthrough.\"\\n\\n\"This is a major breakthrough: dexamethasone is the first and only drug that has made a significant difference to patient mortality for COVID-19. Potentially preventing 1 death in every 8 ventilated patients would be remarkable,\" Cammack said in the statement.\\n\\n\"Finding effective treatments like this will transform the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lives and economies across the world. While this study suggests dexamethasone only benefits severe cases, countless lives will be saved globally,\" Cammack said in part. \"Dexamethasone must now be rolled out and accessed by thousands of critically ill patients around the world. It is highly affordable, easy to make, can be scaled up quickly and only needs a small dosage.\"\\n\\nGet CNN Health\\'s weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nNow researchers and physicians around the world are calling for the Recovery Trial team to release its data on dexamethasone as a potential treatment for severe Covid-19.\\n\\n\"The Oxford group\\'s important results, based on a scientific trial in over 6000 NHS patients, show that dexamethasone -- a common, widely used, inexpensive medicine -- can save lives in seriously ill patients with COVID-19,\" Robin Ferner, honorary professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Birmingham and honorary consultant physician at the City Hospital Birmingham in England, said in a statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"It is not a treatment for mild disease,\" he said. \"We hope the data on which these results are based will be published as soon as possible so that doctors can confidently put the treatment into practice.\"',\n",

In fact, doing workouts like this that uses the whole body has improved aerobic fitness and muscle strength in young sedentary females, according to research\\n\\nSo even if you only fit this into your schedule a few times a week, the shorter bursts of a circuit workout like this one will still have a positive impact on your body.\\n\\nBy taking minimal rest time in between exercises, you're accomplishing a cardiovascular workout even while doing strength-training exercises. Wherever and however you decide to incorporate the family, you'll speed up your heart rate and firm up your muscles.\\n\\nPut yourself through the paces of this routine the next time you're watching your kids play outside. Or have them join in on the fun so that while one person does one exercise, another person does the next exercise, and so on. After completing your exercise, you move on to the next one.\\n\\nMonkey bar moves\\n\\nTricep dips: This move works the muscles in the shoulders, arms, back and core, just as swinging from monkey bars would. You can perform these tricep dips and modified push-ups on a curb, step or bench.\\n\\nTo start, find a step or curb and sit down on it. Place your hands on the step behind you and bend your knees. Walk your feet forward so that your legs are straight out in front of you and the heels are on the ground. Keep your back straight up and down.\\n\\nBend the elbows to lower yourself down toward the ground and then press down through your hands to come up. This works the backs of your arms (the triceps). Repeat 10 times.\\n\\nPush-ups: Then, stand up and face the step. Place your hands on the step as wide as your shoulders and walk your feet out away from the step into a push-up position.\\n\\nPull the naval in toward the spine and bend the elbows out to the sides to lower your chest toward the ground.\\n\\nThen press down through the hands to come up to the starting position. Repeat this 10 times.\\n\\nClimbing up the slide\\n\\nMountain climbers: Kids love climbing up slides — which is a similar body movement to mountain climbers on the grass, sidewalk or driveway.\\n\\nPlace your hands on the ground with your shoulders over your wrists. Next place your feet on the ground with your butt up in the air. Step your right foot forward in between your hands, and then step it back. Step your left foot forward in between your hands, and then step it back.\\n\\nRepeat this quickly 20 times so that it almost becomes as fast as a run.\\n\\nLet's swing without the set\\n\\nSwinging double-toe taps: At the playground, swings are a favorite activity. But if you don't have a swing set, you can still do swinging double-toe taps as an ab exercise while sitting on a step or curb.\\n\\nSit down and bend your knees. Squeeze your legs and inner thighs together. Lift your feet up off of the ground and pull your naval in toward your spine. You may lean back slightly.\\n\\nBring your knees up as high as you can, and then slowly lower them down to tap your toes on the ground. Repeat 20 times.\\n\\nJump up on the slide\\n\\nModified box jumps: Out on the playground, children may jump up onto a slide or park bench. Similarly, at a gym, you'd likely see a box that's a few feet high and you'd work to jump up onto the box. If you're in your front yard, you can jump up onto the curb.\\n\\nTo jump, bend your knees and your arms. Press down through the heels as you jump forward and swing your arms back, landing with a soft bend in your knees and both feet on the curb at the same time.\\n\\nThen, jump backward and land softly again with your knees bent. Repeat this for 20 box jumps.\\n\\nHigh-intensity dash\\n\\nWind sprint: Act as if you're sprinting to the next playground game or activity. Run as fast as you can, in a sprint, for 10 seconds. Pump your arms and look straight forward as you run.\\n\\nTake a quick rest (about five seconds) and then repeat. Repeat this five times.\\n\\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\\n\\nGo through this cycle of exercises a total of three times to get in a full-body workout that'll get your heart pumping and leave you feeling energized.\\n\\nDo this playground circuit every other day to allow your body to recover and rebuild on the off days.

      "                    'text': 'A new report commissioned by the Independent Restaurant Coalition reveals that as many as 85% of US independent restaurants may be forced to close down by the end of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nThe findings revealed that independent restaurants’ revenues decreased by more than 70% year over year in the last two weeks of March.\\n\\nCurrently, independent restaurants’ revenues are, on average, 60% lower than last year’s numbers. Many such eateries are still closed, which means that around 4.5 million independent restaurant jobs have been lost due to the outbreak.\\n\\n“In fact, job losses in the restaurant industry account for more than a quarter of the increase to the US unemployment figures since February, figures that have not been seen since the Great Depression,” the report notes.\\n\\nIndependent restaurants, unlike fast food chains, are highly dependent on dine-in revenue and thus have been hit particularly hard by the outbreak.\\n\\nThe closing down of as many as 85% of independent restaurants will also undeniably impact the American economy. According to the report, such establishments are a large part of the restaurant industry as a whole, which generates more than $760 billion in annual sales and employs millions of people across the US.\\n\\n“With millions of jobs at stake, the collapse of independent restaurants would ignite a downward economic spiral with ripple effects in other already hard-hit industries in the travel, hospitality and leisure sector that would be felt for years. Mass failure may also destabilize the commercial real estate market if these restaurants cannot pay rent, which could also incite a spillover effect in the larger economy,” the report warns.\\n\\nTo ensure that independent restaurants survive the end of the year, the Independent Restaurant Coalition suggests that the federal government provide grants to such businesses through the Restaurant Stabilization Fund.\\n\\n“Swift intervention with an infusion of $120 billion through the Restaurant Stabilization Fund (the ‘Stabilization Fund’ or the ‘Fund’) would give independent restaurants the ability, confidence, and incentive to re-hire employees and stay open (or re-open) – even at reduced capacity, when they would otherwise find it to be in their best interest to remain closed or only offer takeout,” the report argues.\\n\\nThe Independent Restaurant Coalition predicts that the Stabilization Fund would lead to at least $248 billion in economic returns.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlex Jones is joined by investigative journalist Lee Stranahan to expose the parallels between the recent revolution in Ukraine and Black Lives Matter/Antifa race riots in the U.S.\\n\\nThe first-ever nascent iodine Survival Shield X-2 Spray is finally here!

However, Jenny Gilruth, the Scottish minister for Europe and international development, said merging Dfid with the Foreign Office was a “deplorable decision”. She said:\\n\\nInternational development is about reducing global poverty and we are fully committed to playing our part in tackling shared global challenges including poverty, injustice and inequality. We urge the UK government to reverse its decision, to protect the jobs at Dfid in Scotland and to ensure that UK aid is free from political influence.\\n\\nJohnson told MPs the Dfid jobs in East Kilbride would stay.

He needed eight operations to remedy the damage caused by his misdiagnosis.\\n\\nPrivate hospitals can help the NHS recover from Covid-19 - here's how | Jim Mackey Read more\\n\\nThe man, his wife and his GP spent three weeks after his discharge trying to get him urgent medical care. However, St Mary’s hospital on the Isle of Wight rejected repeated pleas by them for doctors to help him, even though his health was deteriorating sharply.\\n\\nThe man, who does not want to be named, said his experience of seeking NHS care for something other than Covid-19 during the pandemic had been “debilitating and exhausting” and that feeling the NHS “was not there” for him had been “very distressing” for him and his wife.\\n\\nMary Smith, of the solicitors Novum Law, who are representing the man in his complaint against the trust, said his plight highlighted the growing number of cases that were emerging of people whose health had suffered because they could not access normal NHS care in recent months.\\n\\n“It is evident in this case that something went badly wrong and our client was failed by the system. The NHS was designed to offer ‘cradle to the grave’ medical treatment for all, yet our client was not able to access urgent treatment when he needed it,” said Smith.\\n\\nThe man’s wife said: “Not only was my husband sent home when he shouldn’t have been, but no matter how hard we tried, neither we, our GP or the paramedics could arrange for a hospital to take him.\\n\\n“By the time an NHS 111 doctor insisted he go straight to the hospital he was so unwell [that] his life was in danger.\\n\\n“If the hospital had got the diagnosis right in the first place, or not discharged him when they cleared the ward on the day of the lockdown, all this would never have happened.”\\n\\nHer husband was admitted to St Mary’s on 22 March with pain in his abdomen and groin from a flare-up of an existing hernia problem. The next morning he was scanned but then sent home after doctors wrongly diagnosed his condition as having inflamed testicles. They told him to take antibiotics.\\n\\nHe said he was one of many patients who were also discharged that day.\\n\\nIn the following weeks St Mary’s hospital had refused to readmit him, despite his symptoms worsening. The man’s wife rang 10 private hospitals on the mainland but all had said they could not treat her husband as they had been taken over by the NHS as part of a deal to provide extra NHS care during the pandemic.\\n\\nIn desperation she rang 999 on 12 April. But staff at St Mary’s told the ambulance crew not to bring him in and instead to tell him to ring NHS 111. He was finally readmitted later that day when the NHS 111 doctor who answered his call recognised how serious the situation was. He was then diagnosed as having appendicitis within his hernia, sepsis and necrotising fasciitis.\\n\\nAn inquiry by the trust found that “there was a missed diagnosis on 22 March”. The patient had to spend three weeks in hospital after he was readmitted, but infection control procedures at St Mary’s to reduce the spread of the coronavirus meant his wife was not allowed to visit.\\n\\nIn a letter to the patient acknowledging that mistakes were made, Isle of Wight NHS trust’s chief executive, Maggie Oldham, apologised and said: “The trust accepts that had surgery on the right inguinal hernia been undertaken during the admission of 22 to 23 March 2020 the subsequent pain, sepsis and numerous returns to theatre would have been avoided.”\\n\\nA spokesperson for the Isle of Wight trust said: “We sincerely apologise for the experience that this person had in our care, following a misdiagnosis in March 2020 that resulted in the patient having to spend a long time in hospital during April and May. The changes to the hospital environment as a result of Covid-19 are in place to protect those in our care and we have not discharged patients early who require continued hospital treatment.”\\n\\nPeter Walsh, the chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents (AvMA), said he believed that the trust was the first to admit that patients’ health had suffered as a result of hospitals across the UK urgently reorganising services to prioritise the fight against Covid-19. The charity was now hearing of many similar cases.\\n\\nNHS England, hospital bosses, health charities and AvMA are voicing increasing concern that some of the many millions of patients who have missed out on diagnosis or care during the pandemic, including those with cancer and heart problems, will experience health declines.\\n\\nNiall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS providers of care, last week warned: “The virus has inflicted pain and suffering throughout the UK. But we also know the measures to combat it have come at a terrible cost to those who have not been able to access the care, treatment and support they need and to many whose conditions have gone undiagnosed.”\\n\\nThe Guardian reported last week how Sherwin Hall, a 27-year-old delivery driver in Leeds, was fighting for his life after his cancer spread from his pelvis during March, April and May when he could not get a scan.\\n\\nThe leader of England’s surgeons on Tuesday warned that it would be “four or five years” before the NHS could again give people non-urgent surgery within the target of 18 weeks. Prof Derek Alderson, the president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, also told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee that the NHS should continue using private hospitals to help tackle the big backlog of care that had built up because of the suspension of normal care.\\n\\nIf there was a second wave of Covid-19, patients needing cancer surgery, a cataract removal or hip or knee replacement could potentially have their operations in one of the Nightingale hospitals, which were built to help with the pandemic but quickly mothballed, he added.\",\n",

      "                    'text': 'On a normal weekend, rue d’Aligre, near Place de la Bastille in Paris’s 12th arrondissement, is lined with raucous fruit and vegetable stalls and packed with shoppers and tourists heading for the historic Marché d’Aligre at its northern end. But now the stalls of the covered market are gone – they’ve moved to the open square in front of the food hall for easier social distancing – and the street’s bistro and bar owners are busy setting out tables and chairs on the pavement and in parking places.\\n\\nUntil President Macron’s new announcement on 14 June of the opening up all of France from 15 June , Paris was classed as a zone orange, which meant restaurants and cafes could only serve customers outside. But Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, who has an election coming up on 28 June, delighted everyone except her rivals and motorist groups at the beginning of June by announcing a major relaxation of the rules on pavement terraces. And although cafes and restaurants can now reopen their inside spaces – albeit with reduced capacity due to social distancing regulations – Hidalgo has announced that the new terrace rules will last at least until the end of September.\\n\\nThis is an opportunity to permanently revolutionise the landscape of outdoor dining. Hidalgo has long talked about giving Paris back to Parisians by limiting car access, creating pedestrian streets and green areas, and prioritising bikes and trottinettes (kick scooters). “I am certainly in favour of a longer term extension of the enlargement of certain cafe terraces, as long as it is properly overseen by the municipality,” she said during a campaign walkabout of Aligre market at the weekend. “Most importantly, after all their efforts during the confinement, it is just a delight to see Parisians enjoying the liberty of meeting friends again on our famous pavement terraces.”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest L’Ebauchoir bistro. Photograph: John Brunton\\n\\nOn rue de Cîteaux, on the other side of the covered market, L’Ebauchoir is a neighbourhood bistro loved by both loyal locals and tourists who’ve read rave reviews of chef Thomas Dufour’s bistronomie cuisine. “On a full day the restaurant serves some 250 people,” says sommelier and co-owner Thierry Bruneau, somewhat wistfully. “When we were finally allowed to reopen, serving only on the pavement terrace, we increased the number of seats outside from 24 to 60, so with three sittings we can welcome 180 customers. If we can continue like that until the end of September, it will be a huge economic boost. So far the weather hasn’t been good for outdoor dining but we are ready to reinvent ourselves, to bring life back into our neighbourhood, a return of the Parisian joie de vivre.”\\n\\nOlivier Facon is a retired barman whose day begins with a morning espresso at his local bar, Le Ballon Vert, an Irish sports pub a short walk away on rue de Montreuil. “I missed this ritual during the two months of confinement,” he says. “But now just look, there must be more than a hundred people sitting on the newly expanded pavement terrace. – ” The bar’s owner, Donal Loughney, says: “It has been difficult for the staff to keep a check on customers – that they respect social distancing and wear a mask when coming in to use the toilet. And when football and rugby come back, we will have to work hard to find ways to keep things orderly and safe but still fun.”\\n\\nNot everyone is happy about the new cafe terraces. Marc Benard is our neighbourhood plumber and a regular fixture outside bistro Les P’tits Gros, to the south on Boulevard Diderot. “This is like a local social club,” he says, “which is why everyone was shocked on reopening day to discover that our favourite doyen, 80-year-old Monsieur Edmond, had been taken by Covid-19 during lockdown. So it is a little strange sitting here today without him and his golden retriever, Hugo, surrounded by all these extra tables, everyone eating, drinking and celebrating as if nothing had happened. I understand that cafes need to make money again quickly, but I think you will soon see tensions in the summer with families trying to push prams or disabled people having to zigzag along a narrow pavement packed with tables of noisy diners.”\\n\\nThe owner of nearby wine bar Le Siffleur de Ballons, Denis Teixeira, smiles when he hears this. “I actually signed the contract to buy this bar à vin just before lockdown, and Monday was the first day I have been able to open bottles for customers. Sure there will be problems sorting out the practicalities of pavement tables, but just imagine what a wonderful opportunity it is, not just for locals but for the tourists who will hopefully return over the summer, to enjoy the unique pleasure of sitting out on a sunny day, eating and drinking on a cafe terrace in the heart of our city.”',\n",

Luckily the landlord said to pay back the arrears when we could but we’ve spent our wedding savings of £3,000 on living costs, so now we’ve got to save that up again as we’ve moved the date to next year.”\\n\\nRecently back in work, Summerton is looking at the positives: “I’ve started a new job back in education recruitment and I’m looking forward to getting my first pay cheque for four months soon.”',\n",

      "                    'text': 'Face coverings causing communication difficulties for the 12m people in UK who are deaf or have hearing loss\\n\\nSee-through face masks should be made widely available, leading deaf charities have said, warning that the growing use of face coverings is causing communication difficulties among the 12 million people in the UK who are deaf or have some form of hearing loss.\\n\\nFace coverings must be worn in England on public transport, and by hospital visitors and outpatients, while all hospital staff must wear surgical masks. Face coverings have also been recommended more widely, including in Scotland, in cases where social distancing is difficult.\\n\\n“The main issue is that people who are deaf and have hearing loss rely heavily on visual clues for effective communication – that includes body language, gestures, facial expression and lip-reading,” said Ayla Ozmen, head of research and policy at Action on Hearing Loss. “British sign language (BSL) users also rely heavily on seeing lip patterns as well as facial expressions to understand BSL.”\\n\\nWhile those who are travelling on public transport in England with someone who relies on lip-reading are exempt from wearing face coverings, something Action on Hearing Loss welcomed, Ozmen said little had been done to publicise this, raising concerns that those legitimately not wearing masks may face abuse.\\n\\nAnd there are other problems, Ozmen said, noting the rules around masks and face coverings in hospitals come into conflict with the accessible information standard, which puts an obligation on health and social care providers to meet people’s communications needs.\\n\\nQ&A Coronavirus: should everyone be wearing face masks? Show Hide People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask. The WHO guidance, announced on 5 June, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used. The WHO says masks should be made of three layers – with cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant. These are no substitute for physical distancing and hand hygiene, it says, but should be worn in situations where distancing is difficult, such as on public transport and at mass demonstrations. The WHO has been reluctant to commit to recommending face coverings, firstly because the evidence on whether they offer any protection to the public is limited and – more importantly – because it was afraid it would lead to shortages of medical-grade masks for health workers. Sarah Boseley Health editor\\n\\n“There has been no guidance from the government on how to handle that conflict in both health settings and social care settings,” she said, adding that with more than 70% of people over 70 having hearing loss, many people admitted to hospital with coronavirus may experience difficulties in communication.\\n\\n“We absolutely understand the public health need for wearing PPE but there is also a really significant concern, a safety concern, if people aren’t able to communicate,” said Ozmen.\\n\\nHolly Parker, an 18-year-old from Essex who is profoundly deaf and largely relies on lip reading, said she had encountered problems as a result of face coverings.\\n\\n“My main method of communication is taken away. In shops I am no longer able to understand shopkeepers and this causes me a lot of anxiety,” she said, adding that she was deeply worried about the prospect of going to university if face masks had to be used during practical lessons.\\n\\nDeaf charities, including Action on Hearing Loss, said they welcomed the development of transparent masks, something Parker and others said would make life easier if widely used.\\n\\nPhilip Gerrard, chief executive at Deaf Action, said the charity had been testing several prototypes of transparent face masks within the deaf community and hoped it would shortly roll these out to members of staff, clients and the wider community.\\n\\n“We would also like to see the government support the development of deaf-friendly face masks that are PPE approved in hospitals and care settings throughout the UK,” he said.\\n\\nIan Noon, head of policy at the National Deaf Children’s Society, agreed, adding: “In the meantime, if people pick up some deaf awareness tips like being patient, writing things down or using gestures if a deaf person needs them to, this would also have a big impact.”\\n\\nThe deafness, cognition and language research centre at University College London also issued a statement calling for greater awareness of the challenges around hearing difficulties and face masks, but said transparent face shields were a better solution, because they let the whole face be seen.\\n\\nBut, it added, dialogue with deaf communities was crucial, noting: “Deaf and hard-of-hearing people are best placed to advise on design needs and ensure any products are fit for purpose.”',\n",

About 50 other stores will close by year-end. Greggs had previously been targeting 100 store openings, on a net basis, per year.\\n\\nAround 800 Greggs shops are set to reopen to takeaway customers on Thursday, after the UK government allowed non-essential stores in England to reopen for the first time in three months. About 19 stores will offer delivery as well as click and collect services.\\n\\nThe move follows the reopening of a handful of branches in the north-east last month.\\n\\nThe Greggs chief executive, Roger Whiteside, said: “Looking forward, although great uncertainty remains, we are excited to be resuming our service for many customers this week.

If the government has no intention of participating, it should reconsider.\\n\\n“Otherwise, this will be a missed opportunity to provide vital information to give tourists and businesses some much needed support.”\\n\\nPaul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy the PC Agency, said: “It’s indicative that at the moment the UK is giving off the impression of being closed for business. Not providing information about how visitors can easily travel around the UK is worrying because it shows a country that wishes to be isolated.\\n\\n“In the current coronavirus crisis, countries have to be as open and communicative as possible about what visitors can see and expect to do, so I would urge the UK to reconsider.”\\n\\nThe EU platform offers information on local border rules, available means of transport, travel restrictions, and health and safety measures such as physical distancing or wearing of face coverings.\\n\\nThierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, said: “After weeks of confinement, EU internal borders are reopening.

The women had “done everything right” and had not put other members of the public at risk, said Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand’s director-general of health, on Tuesday.\\n\\n'Can't quite believe it': New Zealand tiptoes towards elimination of coronavirus Read more\\n\\nBut the news of the women’s travel forced the government to suspend its policy of granting compassionate exemptions to its quarantine rules.\\n\\n“It will only be reinstated once the government has confidence in the system,” said David Clark, the health minister, in a statement. Officials had already announced that no one in future would be permitted to leave quarantine facilities without a negative Covid-19 test, as the women had.\\n\\nAfter both women tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, one reported that in hindsight she had been experiencing symptoms, but had attributed them to a pre-existing medical condition.\\n\\nThe pair mark New Zealand’s first new cases of Covid-19 for more than three weeks, and were diagnosed one week after the last known case in the country had recovered.\\n\\nThe discovery of the new cases came one week after all domestic restrictions on the country were lifted, with Bloomfield warning at the time that more cases of the virus would inevitably arise as people infected with it crossed the border.\\n\\nThe women – one aged in her 30s and the other in her 40s – had arrived in Auckland on a flight from the UK via Brisbane, Australia, on 7 June, Bloomfield said. All new arrivals to the country – only New Zealanders, their families, and essential workers are currently permitted to cross the border – are required to spend two weeks in managed isolation at a hotel.\\n\\nBut six days after the women arrived, Bloomfield said they travelled from Auckland to Wellington “in a private vehicle” after they were granted a compassionate exemption to do so and made a safety plan with officials. They had not been tested for Covid-19 at the time.\\n\\nThe pair had made the drive of approximately eight hours without refuelling their vehicle or disembarking for any reason, including to use public toilets, he said.\\n\\n'A beautiful day': New Zealand handshakes and hugs its way back to pre-Covid-19 life Read more\\n\\n“They had no contact with anybody else during that trip,” added Bloomfield.\\n\\nHe was “not nervous” that the women had infected anyone else, adding that they would now remain in self-isolation with a relative in Wellington. Those permitted to leave the government-run isolation hotels on compassionate grounds are allowed to grieve with their families – but not to attend funerals.\\n\\nAll those on the women’s Air New Zealand flight to Brisbane, including crew, as well as staff and guests at the Novotel Ellerslie hotel in Auckland – where they were initially in quarantine – including staff, would be tested and isolated.\\n\\nA guest at the same hotel – who was also in quarantine – told Television New Zealand that she had not been tested before she left the facility. Those in quarantine are meant to receive Covid-19 swabs on the third and 12th days of their 14-day isolation period.\\n\\n“I have asked the Director General to consider if there are any other measures we can put in place to strengthen our health protections at the border,” Clark, the health minister, said.\\n\\nBut the women who were later diagnosed “did everything that was asked of them,” Bloomfield said, and it was “not surprising” that cases of the virus had entered New Zealand from the UK, where “active infections” remained.\\n\\n“We should not be complacent, we need to remain vigilant,” Bloomfield said. “There is a pandemic raging outside our shores.”\\n\\nThe country has recorded less than 1,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 22 deaths, after a strict and early national lockdown which has drawn praise for Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister.\",\n",

It will alert users whether and for how long they have been in contact at a distance of 2 metres or less with someone who has tested positive for the virus.\\n\\nContact data will not – as initially planned – be saved centrally, only on the smart phones themselves, and the app is based on privacy-focused technology developed by Apple and Google. Users have been assured their private data will not be compromised and neither will the app drain a phone’s battery.\\n\\nUse of the app, which cost €20m to develop, is voluntary but virologists say 60% of Germans must download it for it to become effective.\\n\\nPublic health leaders, computer hackers and government ministers, all of whom had been involved in its development, introduced the app to the public in Berlin on Tuesday morning. By midday it was said to have been downloaded more than 1m times. It has been backed by a massive advertising campaign across broadcasters and on billboards involving leading DAX companies and the German Football Association, the DFB, in the hope of reaching as large an audience as possible.\\n\\nIt follows the introduction of a French warning app, StopCovid, which launched last week but crashed four days later due to huge demand. Australia has introduced a similar system.\\n\\nThe German app has an open source program code, meaning it can be potentially copied and updated by other countries.\\n\\nHelge Braun, the head of chancellor Angela Merkel’s office, and himself a doctor, said downloading the app amounted to “one small step for us, but a giant step in our fight against the pandemic”.\\n\\nLothar Wieler, of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany’s leading public health advisory body, said the app would be an “effective tool to help us break chains of infection”.\\n\\nHe said its introduction would mark the start of the digitalisation of all coronavirus case data, much of which has been gathered so far by about 500 containment scouts who have typically used fax machines to communicate new coronavirus cases to the RKI to ensure data protection.\\n\\nJens Spahn, the health minister, said the app would be vital in speeding up the measures taken to break chains of infection particularly at a time when Germans were becoming more mobile.\\n\\n“We are increasingly coming into contact with anonymous people, whether at demonstrations or on public transport,” he said. “Every hour we gain by an early warning is a gain in our fight against this virus. I’d prefer people to get tested too often than too little.”\\n\\nThe next step, Spahn said, would be to build a system that would work across Europe. Currently, if a German user travels abroad, the app will not work.\\n\\nTimotheus Höttges, of Deutsche Telekom AG, said its laboratory in Prague had been central to developing the app and adapting it to the variety of situations in which users might find themselves.\\n\\n“There we simulated everything from cocktail parties to the school classroom to train journeys,” he said. “When you’re working on something that’s for the benefit of the whole society, it’s amazing the extent of the possibilities.” He said it had taken 50 days to develop, adding: “It was a lot of fun.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

      "                    'text': 'It is fair to say that Britain, with the third-highest coronavirus death toll in the world and its prime minister forced into an intensive care unit to fight for his life, has been distracted from long-running Brexit debates over cod fisheries, customs duties in the Irish Sea and shared aviation standards.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Brexit is still a big deal for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose political career is built upon delivering it, even if pollsters say most Britons now care much more about the economic crisis and the virus.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Monday, Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, alongside leaders of the European Council and European Parliament, held their first high-level talks in months — via a videoconference call between London and Brussels.\\n\\nAfter the closed session, Johnson cheerily said a deal could be reached by July with “a bit of oomph.”\\n\\nEuropean leaders pushed back and said there would be no deal unless Britain agreed to E.U. demands to guarantee a “level playing field.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis remains a major sticking point for the Europeans, who don’t want Britain to have different — read weaker, or more flexible — environmental, health and labor laws, alongside more generous government subsidies, which could give the United Kingdom an unfair trade advantage.\\n\\nCharles Michel, president of the European Council, tweeted after the Johnson meeting, “Ready to put a tiger in the tank but not to buy a pig in a poke. Level playing field is essential.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJohnson’s Conservative Party won a landslide victory in December, based on the promise to “get Brexit done.” But many on both sides of the English Channel assumed the pandemic that has pummeled Britain and the continent might allow for more time to strike a bargain.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn addition to facing a health crisis, all of Europe is probably in recession now, with historic economic contractions predicted for the year.\\n\\nBusinesses in Britain are urging the government to strike a deal, rather than invite the additional instability of an abrupt break with the E.U.\\n\\nCarolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation for Business Industry, a lobbying group, tweeted, “Many businesses are fighting to survive as the impact of COVID-19 unfolds.”\\n\\n“Government has ruled out an extension — business have no choice but to plan on that basis. But that means a deal is the only acceptable option,” she wrote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA recent survey, carried out by polling group Ipsos MORI, found that the majority of Britons were in favor of extending the transition period.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey seemed to be saying: What’s the rush?\\n\\nThe same survey found that more than three-quarters of Britons want the U.K. to work closely with the E.U. on the virus.\\n\\nBen Page, chief executive of Ipsos MORI, said the public’s concerns about Brexit have been pushed aside, primarily by the pandemic and the economy.\\n\\n“The heat has gone out of Brexit because of covid-19 and the recession at the moment. Where we will be next autumn and winter as we approach the deadline of Dec. 31 is another matter,” Page said.\\n\\nThe pollster added that about one third of Britons think their country has already left the E.U. “As for the rest, it isn’t currently the most salient issue, but I suspect the importance of it will gradually rise as we had towards that date.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a joint statement after Monday’s meeting, the two sides noted that Britain did not want to request an extension to the transition period, which ends Dec. 31.\\n\\n“Constructive discussions” were taking place, the parties said, but “new momentum was required.”\\n\\nIn Brussels, officials were pessimistic.\\n\\n“No deal is a risk,” said a European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\\n\\nDiplomats in Brussels watched the talks taking place through Cisco Webex, the main software of the European Commission.\\n\\nThe E.U. negotiators want an agreement with binding commitments on environmental legislation, climate change, money laundering, tax issues and state aid. The U.K. is pushing for a trade deal with few strings attached, the diplomats said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEuropeans want their fishing industry to have deep access to British waters, a red line for London.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut European diplomats say the virus has changed the dynamics.\\n\\nWith the E.U. planning to spend billions to bounce back from the virus, European leaders are less keen to spend hours on the future trade deal with the U.K.\\n\\nE.U. negotiator Michel Barnier last week reminded all that time is short.\\n\\n“We just simply cannot grant to the U.K. access to our market of 450 million people without clear rules guaranteeing the respect of an economic and business fair play,” Barnier said.\\n\\n“As of now, the U.K. is asking us to take their word for it, ensuring it will not engage in unfair competition, nor will seek to weaken European standards. They even say they will maintain standards superior to ours. But British negotiators refuse to commit themselves in the agreement,” he said.',\n",

Earlier Tuesday, North Korea\\'s army, one of the world\\'s largest, warned that it was ready to move forces back into border zones the two Koreas had previously agreed to demilitarize.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe regime also has been criticizing plans by defectors in the South to launch pro-democracy leaflets across the border that are intended to promote human rights and undermine the dictatorship of Kim Jong Un.\\n\\nDemolishing the building was the act of \"enraged people\" retaliating against \"human scum,\" Pyongyang\\'s official Korean Central News Agency said, an apparent reference to the North Korean defectors.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSouth Korea expressed \"severe regret\" at the North\\'s move. Kim You-geun, first deputy chief of Seoul\\'s National Security Council, said it \"betrayed the hopes of peace on the Korean Peninsula.\"\\n\\n\"North Korea will obviously be held accountable for any and all consequences of this incident,\" Kim said, adding that the U.S. ally would take strong actions if the North carries out further provocations.\\n\\nPyongyang\\'s recent outbursts have coincided with the elevation of Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader\\'s younger sister, to a more public role in the regime, fueling speculation among political analysts that officials are readying her for higher office.\\n\\nIn a statement Saturday, she labeled the liaison office \"useless\" and threatened to destroy it \"before long,\" adding that she had asked the military to prepare a \"hostile action\" to unnerve the South.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\"If the South Korean authorities have now [the] capability and courage to carry out at once the thing they have failed to do for the past two years, why are the north-south relations still in stalemate?\" she said.\\n\\nThe remarks demonstrated North Korea\\'s frustration over its inability to win relief from international sanctions after two years of detente and nuclear diplomacy with the United States, including three meetings with President Trump.\\n\\nWith its trade still severely curtailed, North Korea has been unable to develop its economy, while South Korea\\'s center-left government has been unable to move forward with proposals for joint projects that might boost cooperation with its impoverished neighbor, such as cross-border railways.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLeif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said that North Korea is strategically pressuring the South to try to secure concessions on sanctions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\"It\\'s hard to see how such behavior will help the Kim regime get what it wants from the world, but clearly such images will be used for domestic propaganda,\" Easley said. \"So Seoul needs to impose additional costs demonstrating to Pyongyang that its threats are counterproductive.\"\\n\\nEarlier this month, North Korea shut down telephone hotlines with South Korea and threatened to scrap a military agreement unless Seoul stopped the anti-Pyongyang activists. South Korea\\'s government said it would ban the activist groups from sending leaflets and asked the police last week to investigate them.\\n\\nThe liaison office, where officials from the two Koreas were able to communicate around-the-clock, had been temporarily closed since January due to concerns over the novel coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut its destruction is a setback for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has made efforts to coax Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons and end deep-rooted hostilities between the rival Koreas the hallmarks of his presidency. The two nations have remained technically at war since their 1953 armistice.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\"North Korea should not cut off communications, create tensions and go back to the past era of confrontations,\" Moon said in a speech Monday.\\n\\nThe uptick in aggressive behavior from Pyongyang is also unfolding at a time of heightened insecurity in Asia, where China has been forcefully asserting its influence amid concern about the Trump administration\\'s commitments to long-standing U.S. alliances.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Monday, Chinese and Indian forces clashed at their disputed border in the Himalayas in their most serious conflict in decades, leading to fatalities. China has been ramping up threats against Taiwan, the self-governed democracy that Beijing regards as its own territory, tightening its grip over Hong Kong and entrenching control of islands in the disputed South China Sea.\\n\\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Tuesday that Beijing hoped for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.',\n",

      "                    'text': 'An officer and two soldiers died during a “violent faceoff” late Monday that caused “casualties on both sides,” the Indian Army said in a statement. It did not say how they were killed.\\n\\nSenior military officers from both countries are meeting to “defuse the situation,” the army added.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian did not confirm any Chinese casualties at a news briefing Tuesday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nZhao told reporters that Indian troops had twice crossed the Line of Actual Control, the unofficial border that divides the two countries. He accused India of “provoking and attacking Chinese personnel, which led to serious physical conflicts between the two sides.”\\n\\nThe clashes come at a time when China is flexing its muscles across the region amid a global pandemic. In recent weeks, it has confronted Malaysian and Vietnamese vessels in the South China Sea and twice sailed an aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait.\\n\\nIndia and China fought a brief war in 1962 and the border between them remains unresolved. Since May, India and China have been embroiled in tensions at several spots along the border. Soldiers engaged in skirmishes using rocks and sticks and dozens were injured, according to Indian media reports.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe tensions are especially intense at several points in Ladakh, a territory high in the western Himalayas. Analysts say that it is common for both countries to send patrols up to their respective claim lines and retreat, which sometimes leads to altercations.\\n\\nBut while both governments have remained tight-lipped, what has occurred in recent weeks is of a different nature. Chinese troops have crossed several kilometers into territory that India claims at several points, according to analysts and media reports. In particular, reports say, they have occupied an area in the Galwan River valley that overlooks a strategically crucial road for India.\\n\\nMonday night’s deadly clashes took place in the Galwan valley, the Indian Army said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“You’re in a very, very serious situation here,” said Ajai Shukla, an Indian defense analyst and former army officer who has written about the tensions. “This could go any which way.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHu Xijin, editor of the nationalist state-run newspaper the Global Times, said on Chinese-language Weibo that his sources told him there had been Chinese casualties in the clash, but he did not specify if there were any deaths or give further details.\\n\\n“I want to tell Indians: do not misjudge China’s restraint as weakness, and never be arrogant before China,” he said. “China does not want conflict with India, but it is never afraid of conflict.”\\n\\nSong Zhongping, a Chinese military analyst and former lecturer at the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force University of Engineering, accused India of engaging in premeditated escalations “to distract from their domestic political situation.” China needs to “try the best methods to resolve the issue by diplomatic means, but also prepare militarily for the worst outcome.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEarlier this month, the Chinese military staged a drill that moved thousands of paratroopers “within hours” from central Hubei Province to a remote Himalayan mountain range. The exercise, which was publicized by the PLA, was designed to send a message that China was able to rapidly deploy reinforcements to the Indian border and fight in low-temperature and low-oxygen conditions, according to state media.\\n\\nIndian analysts said that China’s actions were another sign of its aggressive intentions in the region. There is a “new edge” to China’s attitude, said Nirupama Rao, a former Indian ambassador to China. “This assertiveness, this readiness to throw [away] internationally accepted behavior to advance their claims and interests, it’s worrisome for so many countries.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShih reported from Seoul.

      "                    'text': \"On Saturday, Kim Yo Jong slammed as “useless” a South Korean liaison office in the city of Kaesong, which served as a de facto diplomatic post for the South. She warned that the office would be destroyed “before long.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat happened Tuesday, when North Korea blew up the building and threatened to move troops into the demilitarized zone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKim Yo Jong’s rise is a stunning shift that has ignited fresh speculation that North Korea’s leader is not in the best of health — despite no firm evidence of illness — and that he could be looking ahead to ensure power remains with the family.\\n\\nSome officials in South Korea initially welcomed the news of Kim Yo Jong’s greater role, hoping she could provide a direct channel to Kim Jong Un in efforts to bring the two Koreas closer.\\n\\nBut several experts in North Korean affairs warned against expecting any change in the regime’s increasingly aggressive posturing — which has blasted holes in the hopes for rapprochement with the United States and South Korea.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKim Yo Jong began her new role in charge of relations with South Korea by picking a fight with the government in Seoul. Then on Friday — the second anniversary of a historic Singapore summit between President Trump and her brother — North Korea issued another broadside: pledging to further bolster its military to counter threats from Washington.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a statement issued earlier this month, Kim Yo Jong complained bitterly about defectors scattering hundreds of leaflets across the border into North Korea, calling them “human scum little short of wild animals” and “riffraff” betraying their homeland.\\n\\n“Now that the mongrel dogs are doing others harm, it is time to bring their owners to account,” she added, threatening to sever ties with the South Korean government unless it cracked down on the defectors’ pro-democracy activism.\\n\\n'Unusually high profile'\\n\\nRachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea analyst for the U.S. government, said North Korean state media gave Kim Yo Jong’s statement an “unusually high profile,” even holding it up as a reference point in articles, rallies and people’s reactions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This clearly was intended to give Kim Yo Jong more prominence than she — and probably any other non-Kim leader — had ever received,” she said, adding that this has transformed her image from being the leader’s sister into a policymaker in her own right.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat has reignited scrutiny about Kim Jong Un’s health, after rumors swirled in April that he was gravely ill or had died. Kim reappeared in public in early May after an unexplained three-week absence, one of several prolonged withdrawals by him from the public eye this year.\\n\\nAndrei Lankov, an Asia scholar and professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, noted that Kim Jong Un has appeared in state media only three times since April 11, once in public, and twice in closed-door meetings, while also not signing official documents at his usual pace.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Something is wrong with Kim Jong Un’s health,” he argued. “And at such times, it’s important to have a deputy. And who can be such deputy? Someone who is unlikely to take all power for himself or herself.”\\n\\nKim’s father and grandfather had elevated siblings into senior positions, and Lankov said Kim Jong Un appeared to be doing the same — particularly because his children are still young.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It’s an established tradition within the Kim family, when your future successor is a bit too young, you just take your sibling because your sibling is reliable, and probably not going to betray you,” he said.\\n\\nNo sign Kim Jong Un is ill\\n\\nBruce Klingner, a North Asia expert at the Heritage Foundation, agreed that Kim Yo Jong’s elevation could be related to concerns about her brother’s health. Kim Jong Il’s stroke in 2008 spurred the leader to prepare his son Kim Jong Un for power.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Klingner noted that there is no evidence that Kim Jong Un’s absences were because of ill health. South Korea says it thinks the North Korean leader has simply been sheltering from the novel coronavirus.\\n\\n“Since his return, Kim has seemed vibrant rather than frail, though, of course, not the picture of health, and he remains morbidly obese,” Klingner said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome experts said Kim Yo Jong’s hard-line comments could be viewed as an attempt to bolster her credibility within the regime. But others said it may simply reflect shifting priorities within North Korea.\\n\\nWhen the North Korean regime felt threatened by the Trump administration and wanted to dial down tensions, Kim Yo Jong visited South Korea for the Winter Olympics in 2018 and presented a friendlier, less-menacing image for the regime.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow North Korea appears to want more concessions from South Korea by amping up the threat level, Lankov said, and Kim’s sister is presenting quite a different picture to the world.\\n\\n'Dark nightmare'\\n\\nPark Jie-won, who served as a South Korean envoy to Pyongyang during the government of president Kim Dae-jung, said he met Kim Yo Yong last June. She came to the border village of Panmunjom to offer condolences on the death of the late president Kim’s widow.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe said her elevation would simplify inter-Korean dialogue because she had direct access to her brother.\\n\\nPark said he was not worried about Kim Yo Jong’s rhetorical attack on South Korea, which he said was aimed at her domestic audience.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet his optimism is not widely shared.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, North Korea announced that it was closing telephone ties with the South, and on Friday, it issued a fierce denunciation of the United States.\\n\\nHope for improved relations had been high during the Singapore summit in 2018, said North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon, but this has given way to “despair characterized by spiraling deterioration.”\\n\\n“Even a slim ray of optimism for peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula,” he said, “has faded away into a dark nightmare.”\",\n",

Border officers eavesdropped, and trucks sped by, drowning out their already muffled conversations, they said.\\n\\nOther couples and families started showing up at the 0 Avenue ditch, too. For months, it was a strange and dusty meetup spot where couples would go to see each other and would often notice others doing the same.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeeting this way was painful, Bosello said, “but it was still better than nothing.”\\n\\nAs the weather warmed and shutdowns lifted, a superior reunion spot emerged in mid-May: Peace Arch Park. There, cross-national couples and families could actually embrace — at long last.\\n\\nThe recently reopened park is situated between Blaine, Wash., and Surrey, B.C.\\n\\n“When I finally hugged him again, it felt like it was the first time I ever did,” Bosello said.\\n\\nIn fact, the couple, who has been together for five years, was so ecstatic to reunite, they took a huge relationship leap. On June 6, they gathered a small group of family and friends and got married.\\n\\n“Being separated made us realize what’s truly important to us,” Smith said. “The circumstances we found ourselves in really highlighted that we wanted to make it official.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe couple ordered silicone rings online to use as temporary wedding bands, and Bosello wore a navy dress she had ordered for a friend’s wedding — paired with sneakers.\\n\\n“It was all very casual and improvised,” Bosello said. “But it was such a wonderful day, and so nice to just turn off everything else going on in the world.”\\n\\nThe couple, who meet at the park daily, is hoping their marriage will speed up the process of Smith becoming a permanent Canadian resident, for which he submitted an application nearly two years ago.\\n\\nSmith is originally from Beltsville, Md., and was serving in the military in South Korea when he met Bosello, who was temporarily working abroad as a teacher.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBosello moved home to Canada three weeks after the couple hit it off at a bar in Seoul, and they’ve been in a long-distance relationship ever since. She stayed in Vancouver while Smith moved to Seattle and finally to Blaine.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe couple would see each other regularly because the drive between their respective homes is only about 40 minutes.\\n\\n“For a while, the distance was very manageable,” Bosello said. “Then the pandemic hit.”\\n\\nThey are not the only couple who had the idea to tie the knot at the border.\\n\\nBefore the park reopened, Liz Peters’s parents drove seven hours from Portland, Ore., to celebrate her wedding along 0 Avenue, while still standing on American soil. The couple married nearby and met her parents right after to celebrate because they couldn’t be at the ceremony.\\n\\n“I’m very close with my parents and could never imagine them not being there on my wedding day,” said Peters, 27, who lives in Abbotsford, B.C.\\n\\nBut as word started getting out about the lucky loophole at Peace Arch Park, lovesick Americans and Canadians began showing up there to be together.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe day after Smith and Bosello tied the knot, Ryan Hamilton, 26, and Savannah Koop, 25, did, too.\\n\\nKoop, a Canadian, and her American husband also met regularly along 0 Avenue before the park reopened, each with their own coffee and snacks, for weekly date nights.\\n\\n“It was so hard to be so close yet so far,” Koop said.\\n\\nWhen the couple heard the park reopened, they also decided to make their love official in the only place they could be together, after their original wedding was canceled because of the pandemic.\\n\\nThis spontaneous ceremony, they said, was even more special after their time apart.\\n\\nThe park is considered equal parts American and Canadian — a shared territory for citizens of both countries to visit. The southern half is owned by Washington State Parks, while the northern half is owned by British Columbia Provincial Parks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEntryways from both the American and Canadian sides are patrolled, and the park itself is surveilled to ensure no one exits the wrong side.

      "                    'text': 'So Carlos Machado, a senior scientist with Brazil’s prestigious Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, wanted the language to be strong. At the request of Rio officials, his team was assembling a list of recommendations. He needed to make clear what would happen if they didn’t immediately impose a complete lockdown.\\n\\n“It would result,” the team warned in the early May report, “in a human catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the officials never instituted a lockdown. Cases and deaths soared. People stopped isolating, choosing instead to pack beach boardwalks on weekends. And the warning turned out to be just one more exit ramp that Brazil declined to take on its way toward becoming the second-most disease-ravaged country in the world.\\n\\nLatin America’s largest country has so far registered more than 888,000 coronavirus cases and nearly 44,000 deaths, second on both counts only to the United States. But while other countries have been through steep curves and are now focused on preparations for a possible second wave, Brazil can’t even get past its first.\\n\\nWhat’s happening here appears to be unique on a global level. Despite soaring numbers, officials never implemented measures largely successful elsewhere in the world. There has been no national lockdown. No national testing campaign. No agreed-upon plan. Insufficient health-care expansion. Instead, the hardest-hit cities are now deciding to open up, throwing open the doors to malls and churches, at a time when the country is routinely posting more than 30,000 new cases a day — five times more than Italy reported at the peak of its outbreak.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe inaction has pushed the country onto a path that scientists call uncharted.\\n\\n“We are doing something that no one else has done,” said Pedro Hallal, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of Pelotas. “We’re getting near the curve’s peak, and it’s like we are almost challenging the virus. ‘Let’s see how many people you can infect. We want to see how strong you are.’ Like this is a game of poker, and we’re all in.”\\n\\nBrazil is on a trajectory to register more than 4,000 deaths per day and overtake the United States in both cases and deaths by the end of July, according to researchers at the University of Washington. But just as the pandemic is magnifying the similarities between the United States and Brazil — two continent-sized countries with extreme inequality and populist presidents — it is also revealing the chasm between them. Brazil has neither the world’s biggest economy, nor one of its strongest health-care systems, nor the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nLimited resources always meant that Brazil had far less room for error — less room for political disagreement in the face of an outbreak — than its more developed peers. But despite the stakes, the country never found unity. President Jair Bolsonaro, who continues to dismiss the disease and its victims, has urged a policy of doing nothing. He has attacked governors who advocated restrictive measures as corrupt liars, waded into crowds of supporters in defiance of his advisers’ admonitions and threatened to host a large barbecue to spite public health recommendations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe never empowered health experts and scientists to lead a response. Instead, they were undermined and ignored, sidelined and pushed out. He fired his first health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, whose sober briefings had calmed anxious Brazilians, after they’d clashed over the need for social distancing. Then he pushed out his replacement, Nelson Teich, who failed to share his zeal for using chloroquine as a coronavirus treatment. (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration this week revoked its emergency authorization to use the anti-malarial drug to treat the coronavirus, saying it was unlikely to be effective but carries “potential serious side effects.”)\\n\\nBolsonaro has now replaced Teich with a military man who isn’t a doctor.\\n\\nThe unfolding disaster underscores the limits of scientific persuasion in a country where faith in institutions has plunged for years. It’s not just federal officials who have declined to follow the experts’ guidelines. Large portions of the population, either because of poverty or apathy, are now living their lives largely as before — going to the beach, attending parties and other get-togethers, riding crowded buses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It was a failure,” said Lígia Bahia, a professor of public health at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “We didn’t have enough political force to impose another way. The scientists alone, we couldn’t do it. There’s a sense of profound sadness that this wasn’t realized.”\\n\\nHaving decided to open up despite scientific consensus that it should not, the country is now lurching down a path that so far only Sweden has attempted to navigate — but in a much less tactical, methodical fashion. In some pockets of the country — particularly the north — one-fourth of people have already developed antibodies to the disease. If herd immunity is to happen in any country, it might happen in Brazil first.\\n\\n“The question is, ‘Where will this go?’ ” said Theo Vos, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington, whose models are used by the White House. “It could be that in Brazil, you could start reaching saturation, where so many people in the population have been in contact with the virus that it starts to come down.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe paused.\\n\\n“But it comes at an enormous toll. It’s the sort of situation that we’re advising governments to try and avoid.\\n\\n“We don’t have another example of where for the moment it is looking bleaker.”\\n\\nOne city in the throes of this wrenching process is Boa Vista, in the underdeveloped and isolated Amazonian state of Roraima. More than one-fourth of its 277,000 residents have developed antibodies to the disease, according to Brazilian scientists conducting an ongoing study. The public system has stopped testing people. Promised field hospitals never materialized. The situation has grown so grave that patients are being flown to Manaus, itself a global symbol of the damage the virus can inflict on the developing world.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut most of the country is far from achieving herd immunity, which occurs when between 60 and 70 percent of the population has been infected by or exposed to a disease or vaccine and can now resist it. By early June, less than 3 percent of the population had covid-19 antibodies. In Rio, where 5,000 people have died, the rate was less than 8 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“No end in sight,” read a large headline in the O Globo newspaper last week.\\n\\nWhen Machado, the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation scientist, was asked how much could have been averted if his warnings had been heeded, he looked pained.\\n\\n“From the point of view of public health, it’s incomprehensible that more rigorous measures weren’t adopted,” he said. “We could have avoided many of the deaths and cases and everything else that is happening in Rio de Janeiro.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It was an opportunity lost.”',\n",

      "                    'text': 'The problem for Netanyahu and his allies is that much of the world opposes their plans. In Washington, Democrats and even some Republicans are against it, with Trump and Netanyahu’s close embrace widening a partisan split over support for Israel.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor the Palestinian leadership, annexation is a non-starter, and they have reacted angrily, suspending coordination with Israel on a host of day-to-day matters. “This is an issue in which we cannot be silent on,” Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told reporters last week. “Annexation is an existential threat for our future.” (Many ordinary Palestinians, though, may argue that it would simply be further confirmation of a long-standing status quo in which their freedoms and political rights are subordinate to — and often curtailed by — the imperatives of Israeli security.)\\n\\nThough Netanyahu and Trump pay lip service to the future viability of an independent Palestinian state, no serious expert believes it would be more likely once the internationally brokered understandings of the past three decades get cleaved apart by a unilateral act of annexation. Instead, the specter of an entrenched apartheid looms.\\n\\nThe annexation of Palestinian territory by the Israeli government would make the occupation permanent. That is unacceptable. I was proud to address thousands of Israelis, Arabs and Jews, demonstrating in Tel Aviv against this outcome. pic.twitter.com/yP8voFi9At — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) June 9, 2020\\n\\nMost of Washington’s foreign policy community recognizes the risks of the moment. “A cost-benefit analysis argues for preserving the status quo,” wrote Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “Israel already enjoys complete security control over the West Bank, its civil law already governs its citizens living there, and it has largely succeeded in normalizing the international community to continued growth in settlement activity. Most relevant actors—the Palestinian Authority, many Arab states, key European capitals, UN Security Council members, and the United States—have reconciled themselves to this reality and do not actively oppose it.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn other words, Netanyahu could endanger the paramount control Israel already maintains over the Palestinian territories, as well as the relative international quiescence over its actions there, including its expansion of settlements over the past couple of decades.\\n\\n“From the Israeli perspective, there has been relative peace in the occupied territory, Palestinian security forces (and not Israel) have regularly policed Palestinian demonstrations, and the international community (and not the Israelis) has paid for much of the costs for the Palestinian security service,” Michael Lynk, the U.N.’s special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, told Today’s WorldView. But for the Palestinians, for whom a genuine state seems further away than ever, the bargains of the 1990s “look very lopsided,” Lynk added.\\n\\nNow, some European governments have condemned the prospect of annexation — with one top diplomat recently branding it “a gross violation of international law” tantamount to “stealing.” Israel’s Arab neighbors are furious. Netanyahu’s relations with King Abdullah of Jordan have sharply deteriorated in recent months, with the royal reportedly refusing a phone call with the prime minister Monday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s lieutenants, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, like to tout the cautious support for their efforts offered by other Arab states, particularly the Persian Gulf monarchies that have found common cause with Israel in large part thanks to their shared antipathy toward Iran. But on Friday, Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE’s ambassador in Washington, published an unprecedented op-ed in Hebrew in one of Israel’s biggest dailies, warning that annexation would be “a misguided provocation” that dooms the tacit rapprochement underway.\\n\\n“We’d like to believe that Israel is an opportunity, not an enemy,” wrote Otaiba, a polished Emirati diplomat close with the Trump administration. “We face too many common dangers and see a huge potential in having warmer relations. A decision by Israel to annex will be an unmistakable sign indicating whether Israel views matters the same way.”\\n\\nUAE Ambassador writes in Israeli newspaper outlining the costs of annexation - versus the great potential of warmer ties.https://t.co/m5RGi3xf7t\\n\\n\\n\\npic.twitter.com/Mh5x1qDqGM — هند مانع العتيبة Hend Al Otaiba (@hend_mana) June 12, 2020\\n\\nEven many prominent retired officials in the Israeli security establishment are opposed to annexation, fearing the collapse of the Palestinian Authority’s legitimacy and the rise of militant factions like Hamas. “What might start after July 1 with a Knesset vote on a partial annexation may soon thereafter spin out of control and lead to a complete Israeli takeover of the West Bank and Gaza, meaning that Israel’s military would be the sole entity ruling over millions of Palestinians—with no exit strategy,” wrote Ami Ayalon, Tamir Pardo and Gadi Shamni, three former top-ranking Israeli commanders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat’s a reality they may want to avoid for strategic and moral reasons. Annexation “will lead to a cascade of grievous human rights consequences,” said Lynk, who is also a Canadian law professor. “And it will solidify not the creation of a Palestinian state, but the completion of a Palestinian Bantustan, an archipelago of disconnected islands of territory, completely surrounded and divided up by Israel and unconnected to the outside world.”\\n\\nFaced with rising global anger and scrutiny, Netanyahu could yet pull back, already assured of a discreet political victory. “He wants to get credit for making this an issue and for changing the discourse,” Haaretz journalist Anshel Pfeffer told my colleague Ruth Eglash. “For many years, the conversation was about Israel dismantling settlements and retreating to achieve peace. Now the conversation is about Israel going forward and annexing the settlements. Even if nothing changes on the ground, this might be enough for Netanyahu.”\\n\\nBut other pressures may come to bear, not least the possibility that, after November’s U.S. presidential election, the winds could be blowing in a different direction in Washington. “This may be a political window that will soon close again,” Lynk said. “A full or partial annexation seems more likely than not doing anything.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD',\n",

He said Monday that he plans to appeal the court’s decision.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow that Whelan has been convicted, speculation is rife about a possible prisoner exchange with the United States. Zherebenkov said Monday that “Paul expected this decision because even when he was detained, he was told [by Russian security service agents] that he would be exchanged.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWithout revealing his source, Zherebenkov said he was told Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot who was arrested in 2010 for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the United States, and Viktor Bout, a gun runner who inspired the 2005 Hollywood film “Lord of War,” are the people the Kremlin is focused on as possible trades for Whelan’s release.\\n\\n“I heard talk that, why should we waste time on the appeal if we can just go ahead with the exchange?” Zherebenkov said. “I can’t give you any names, but I know that the exchange is being discussed.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn July, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov suggested the United States should “free Yaroshenko, swap him for an American or Americans who are serving their sentence here,” according to the Interfax news agency.\\n\\n“I’m in no position to discuss prisoner exchanges,” U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan said Monday. “Paul has now just become a convict in the Russian system. I’m advocating for justice for Paul. . . . What we’re looking for is not an exchange; we’re looking for justice for Paul Whelan.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven before the verdict was announced, Whelan appeared to believe a guilty result was a foregone conclusion, shouting from within a glass-enclosed area in the courtroom that Russia “feels impotent in the world, so they’re taking political hostages.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This is slimy, greasy, rubbish Russian politics — nothing more, nothing less,” Whelan called out to reporters.\\n\\nAfter the verdict, Whelan shouted that he had no English interpretation and had no idea what decision was announced.\\n\\nSpeaking on the courthouse steps after the verdict, Sullivan described the case as “a mockery of justice.”\\n\\n“Is this an impediment? Absolutely,” he said of the relationship between Moscow and Washington, referring to current affairs as at a “low ebb.”\\n\\nThe U.S. Embassy has repeatedly condemned what it called the prosecution’s lack of evidence and described Whelan’s treatment as “shameful.” He was not permitted to phone his family until 16 months into his detainment, and the embassy said he did not have access to English-speaking doctors for a preexisting inguinal hernia.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter experiencing “severe abdominal pain” late last month, Whelan had an “emergency hernia operation” at a Moscow hospital, Whelan’s twin brother, David Whelan, said in an email, citing information from the embassy. The surgery was successful, he said.\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday in a statement that “the treatment of Paul Whelan at the hands of Russian authorities has been appalling.”\\n\\n“The United States is outraged by the decision of a Russian court today to convict U.S. citizen Paul Whelan after a secret trial, with secret evidence, and without appropriate allowances for defense witnesses,” the statement said. “We have serious concerns that Mr. Whelan was deprived of the fair trial guarantees that Russia is required to provide him in accordance with its international human rights obligations.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe trial, which began in March, was largely behind closed doors, with the court citing the classified materials in the case. Proceedings continued despite the strict coronavirus-related restrictions imposed in Russia’s capital.\\n\\n“Whelan was under surveillance for a number of years; there was a certain script, and there were obvious elements of provocation,” Zherebenkov said. The lawyer added that over the course of many trips to Russia, Whelan got to know about 60 people, “but not a single one has stated that Paul tried to recruit them.”\\n\\nWhelan, who also has Canadian, Irish and British citizenship, was the corporate security director at BorgWarner, a Michigan-based automotive parts supplier, at the time of his arrest. He received a bad-conduct discharge from the Marines in 2008, according to military records.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I need the president of the United States and the prime ministers of Canada, Ireland and England to act decisively to end this political charade,” Whelan said in the courtroom Monday.\\n\\nThe Canadian government said Monday that it is “deeply concerned” by Whelan’s conviction and sentencing and that it would continue to provide consular assistance to him and his family.\\n\\n“The severity of the sentence clearly demonstrates that Russia is using its judicial system as a political tool,” said Angela Savard, a spokeswoman for Global Affairs Canada. “Canada calls upon Russia to ensure a fair and transparent appeal process free of political interference.”\\n\\nAD',\n",

      "                    'text': '\\n\\nHail wrecked the siding of homes in Calgary on Saturday. (Ben Chernesky/Twitter @Zombery360)\\n\\nA vicious hailstorm pounded Calgary, Canada, on Saturday, turning a summer day into a virtual winter wonderland as chunks of ice the size of tennis balls ricocheted out of the sky. Wind-driven hailstones shattered windows and windshields, peeled the siding off homes and businesses, and coated the ground several inches thick, making it a monochromatic icy landscape.\\n\\n[Towering corkscrew-shaped storms swirled over Alberta last June]\\n\\nTrees were stripped bare in some areas where heavy hail shredded vegetation. Elsewhere, reports of funnel clouds accompanied the ominous storm as it churned through the city of 1.4 million.\\n\\nThe same storms produced serious flooding, inundating streets and leaving numerous vehicles up to their canopies in water. The region had been under a severe thunderstorm watch for much of the afternoon.\\n\\nCalgary International Airport first reported thunder at 6:40 p.m. Saturday, around the same time Environment Canada issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the city. Hail began falling at the airport at 7:02 p.m., the temperature slipping 5.4 degrees in six minutes as ice piled up and cooled the ground.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe GOES West weather satellite reveals the “overshooting top” of a potent thunderstorm that hit Calgary on Saturday. (RAMMB/CIRA)\\n\\nThe hail briefly stopped at the airport at 7:09 p.m. but resumed at 7:16 p.m. During the same window, winds pivoted from southerly to almost due northerly. That’s probably indicative of the “rear flank downdraft” passing over the airport. That’s a region of a rotating thunderstorm that features a crash of precipitation and a surge of high-altitude chilly air on a thunderstorm’s backside. Visibilities dropped to a quarter-mile as the hail core passed overhead.\\n\\nIt’s unclear just how big the hail got, but in parts of the city, it was estimated to be the size of a golf ball or even a tennis ball. It appears some of the largest may have fallen in the CornerBrook neighborhood just northeast of the airport. Social media images revealed the siding of homes destroyed, with hail littering the streets after puncturing holes in windshields.\\n\\n\\n\\nHail stripped siding off this home in Calgary on Saturday. (Marita Lund-Roberts)\\n\\nIn some areas, an abundance of small hail came down, piling up to several inches deep. The scene resembled that of a winter snowstorm, flashes of lightning reflecting off the icy white background like strobe lights in a disco. Piles formed beneath gutters and roofs where chutes of hail became concentrated.\\n\\nSome residents even reported the ice balls rocketing through windows and into homes.\\n\\nEqually problematic was severe flooding, especially along the northern side of Calgary. Hail contributed to clogging storm drains, the frozen pebbles caught in the rapids and carried down area roadways like debris in a roaring river.\\n\\n\\n\\nHeavy rainfall triggered flash flooding in Calgary on Saturday. (Rohan Johnson/Twitter)\\n\\nDeerfoot Trail — Route 2 — was flooded after nearly two inches of rain fell in one hour. Vehicles became stuck in the floodwaters, submerged beneath a rapidly rising sea of rain and hail. Some routes had already become virtually impassible, drivers hampered by mounds of hail. Others had previously suffered shattered windshields.\\n\\nFunnel clouds were also seen south of the city, with reports that a tornado may have touched down to the southeast.\\n\\nA tornado was also spotted in Taber, about 100 miles southeast of Calgary.\\n\\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported that more than 10,000 customers lost power for a time following Saturday’s storms.\\n\\nCanada may not feature the prolific tornado outbreaks common to the Great Plains, but a sliver of traditional Tornado Alley extends north into the Canadian Prairie. Southeastern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba do occasionally get significant severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. A secondary hot spot stretches from near Toronto to Quebec.\\n\\nViolent tornadoes can and occasionally do strike Canada. On June 22, 2007, Canada’s first and only recorded F5 tornado ravaged Elie, Manitoba, causing more than $40 million in damage. Elie is located 30 miles west of Winnipeg.\\n\\nMore recently, sculpted supercell thunderstorms swirled across Alberta on June 18 last year.

      "                    'text': 'Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported the highest single-day increase since the start of the pandemic: 136,000 new infections on June 7. (The tally by Johns Hopkins University has slightly different figures.) Days later, the United States surpassed 2 million confirmed cases, cementing its place at the top of the confirmed infections ranking.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOverall, more than 7.3 million people worldwide have tested positive for the coronavirus and more than 413,000 people have been confirmed to have died of covid-19. And those are just the infections and deaths we know about.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven if the recent surge in confirmed numbers may be due in part to increases in the availability of testing, the virus is nowhere near going away, experts say. As early hot spots begin to recover, the epicenters of the pandemic shift. Amid a widespread relaxation in restrictions, from Israel to Iran to South Korea to China, new clusters have formed.\\n\\nThree months after much of the world shut down, the United States, Brazil, Russia and India are reporting the highest numbers of new daily cases.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnited States\\n\\nWhat began in Washington and New York states has come for Arizona, Florida and Texas. Stay-at-home orders helped slow the initial spread as testing lagged. But states have largely lifted measures, and on Sunday, both Alabama and South Carolina hit single-day records in new confirmed cases. Hospitals in Houston are reporting record numbers of patients.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPublic health experts warn that states moving to reopen too fast could lead to fresh round of infections. Numbers so far indicate that has been the case. Coupled with the masses of people who have marched together in protests against racism and police violence, the coming weeks could see further increases.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBeing outdoors at a distance from others, wearing a mask and washing hands, scientists say, are among the best preventive measures. At the same time, experts are already warning about the winter, when the flu hits hospitals, schools and workplaces, compounding stress on the system.\\n\\nBrazil\\n\\nThe virus spread through Asia. Then it surged in Europe. Now Latin America is the center of the global pandemic, according to the WHO. Even countries in South America that were quick to shut down, such as Peru and Chile, are seeing infections rise as they ease their restrictions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Brazil — where the federal government, led by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, has downplayed the virus — never went into a complete lockdown. Instead, governors and mayors at their own discretion closed schools and shops as the virus kept expanding its reach and the president kept belittling its severity. What began as a cluster among rich Brazilians with the resources to travel has turned into a crisis hitting neglected poor and indigenous Brazilians hardest.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow, as the above graph shows, Brazil’s outbreak is still widening. The country has confirmed more than 42,000 covid-19 deaths and more than 867,000 cases.\\n\\nRussia\\n\\nIn mid-March, Russian President Vladimir Putin boasted that the coronavirus, then wreaking havoc across Europe, wasn’t a problem for him back at home. Months later, Russia has the third-highest number of confirmed cases and among the fastest-growing outbreaks worldwide.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGiven trajectories elsewhere, that’s not much of a surprise: Russia’s shutdowns, which it is easing, helped to slow but not stop the virus’s spread. But what is “difficult to understand,” WHO expert Mike Ryan said during a briefing last week, is how Russia has maintained such a low mortality rate — just over 7,000 confirmed deaths — in tandem with rising infections. Doctors and nurses have been speaking out, despite the danger of doing so in the repressive state, about dire conditions in hospitals.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a rebuke to the official narrative, Russian officials last week issued revisions that raised some death tolls for April and May. The virus, after all, is immune to Putin’s usual tactics for maintaining control.\\n\\nIndia\\n\\nIndia imposed one of the world’s strictest shutdowns on its more than 1.3 billion people in March. By May, the country started to lift restrictions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut even with strict restrictions in place, India’s case numbers continued to rise. That’s because India hasn’t yet been able to flatten its curve, with the shutdowns succeeding only somewhat in slowing the rate of the virus’s spread.\\n\\nSome 99 percent of the hospital beds in Mumbai, a city of 12 million people, are filled. Delhi’s chief minister warned last week that the number of cases there could reach 500,000 by July, up from the city’s current 35,000 confirmed infections. Sick people already struggle to find an open hospital bed.',\n"
